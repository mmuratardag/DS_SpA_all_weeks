"I saw you down across the water You're floating safely in the way you do Then I scrammed before you saw me I've gotta keep thinking you wanted to By the shoreline, will you be fine? Or will it cover you? And when you taste it, will you embrace it? What will you let it do to you? Grab a look across the water We grab a smile and then you're gone a while With you it'd be across the water When I'm losing it I like your style By the shoreline, will you be fine? Or will it cover you? And when you taste it, will you embrace it? What will you let it do to you?Come on, baby Drive me out of mind Mind if I come home, along with you And see what you do This is crazy And nothing more I want to See The sea is not the safest place to sit And be so spacy Scary things across the water You'd never know Till they have their way with you You won't catch me dip in the water However much I want to play with you [Solo] Don't stay in long No one's that strong Enough, not to crumble Whenever the water wants you Don't be so crazed I'm just tryin' to save You from losing everything you've got This is no time to rot Don't be fooled by All the coolness rushing by Don't let it grab your mind Pull out now or you will find All you strive for Nothing, gone, no more You're his servant now",dinosaur jr

[mumbling...] And the toads are running free And ? [mumbling...] It's no fun to that's what stinks Bought a carrot and still can't see You know I've been wating for 6 years For a ray of hope, leaves me a float Then I could believe in sunshine In the winter time, mountains glow There's always so much to adore There's a little scenic picture on my skull See the second building Imagine, Where'd You go All I wanna know babyDoes it float Does it float Does it float Does it float Does it float Does it floatDoes it float Does it Float Does it Float Does Float Why Does it float Does it float",dinosaur jr

"I sit queasy, jittered, uneasy The toll that looms, the loss [cows] I dread I buckle, when my judge clutches Questioning my treatment of an ego underfed Bulbs of passion Bulbs of passionPlace it here on the bureau Let the interests rip apart the understood No one's satisfied with merely a cut So they sabotage their own livelihoodThe feeble structure is teetering, but intact The parts all function but the fuse is lit Teeth scrape on the last remaining fossil I wanna to crumble but instead I slitAnd hold it in my hand But they're sweating Train for now, but soon forget The tears are flowing from the love in her eyes The hated feeling gonna eat me alive Bulbs of passion Bulbs of passion Bulbs of passion Bulbs of passion",dinosaur jr
"What is it? Who is it? Where is it?A rabbit falls away from me, I guess I'll crawl A rabbit always smashes me, again I'll crawl Tried to think what's over me, it makes me crawl Then she runs away from me, faster than I crawl I stopped to call, tried to feel it all Stuck my hand and pulled real hard Got stretch in miles, not in yards Then I read, about all those who believe all of your lies Sunlight brings the rage right in your eyesA rabbit falls away from me, I guess I'll crawl A rabbit always smashes me, again I'll crawl Tried to think what's over me, it makes me crawl Then she runs away from me, faster than I crawlA rabbit falls away from me, I guess I'll crawl A rabbit always smashes me, again I'll crawl Tried to think what's over me, it makes me crawl Then she runs away from me, faster than I crawl",dinosaur jr
