D. M. S. O. Crypto Wonder Drug In vogue Some people say It cures arthritis Maybe that's why It keeps getting banned It's absorbed Directly through the skin Mix it with lemon juice Touch your fingertips You'll taste the lemon The police Started a riot Down at the courthouse Again Running amok Spilling blood Bashing heads I do my part Behind the lines Swabbing door handles of cop cars With D.M.S.O. Mixed with L.S.D.....,dead kennedys

"Well I don't care if it rains or freezes, Long as I got my plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. Through all trials and tribulations, And my travels through the nations, With my plastic Jesus I'll go far.Oh Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. I'm afraid he'll have to go, His magnets ruin my radio, And if I have a wreck, he'll leave a scar.Riding down a thoroughfare, With his nose up in the air, A wreck may be ahead, but he don't mind. Trouble coming, he don't see, Just keeps his eyes on me, And any other thing that lies behind.Oh, Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. Though the sun shines on his back, Makes him peel, chip and crack, A little patching keeps him up to par.When pedestrians try to cross, I let them know who's boss, Never blow the horn or give them warning. I ride all over town, Trying to run them down, It's seldom that they live to see the morning.Oh, Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. His halo fits just right, And I use it for a sight, They'll scatter or they'll splatter, near and far.If I weave around at night, And the police think I'm tight, They'll never find my bottle though they ask. (yes they ask) Plastic Jesus shelters me, For his head comes off you see, He's hollow and I use him for a flask.Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. (of my car) Ride with me and have a dram, Of the blood of the lamb, Plastic Jesus is a holy bar.Oh, Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. Once his robe was snowy white Now it isn't quite so bright Stained by the smoke from my cigar. Oh, Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. I'm afraid he'll have to go, his magnets ruin my radio, And if I have a wreck, he'll leave a scar.",dead kennedys

In a desperate mind Little gardens grow They grow very wide They grow very tallWhy am I alive Urban Wonderland By the fence I stand In and out of handThere are many paths Dripping dark so dense Do not enter here Enter over therePeople closing in Barking at my mind Shoving me to wine I want all aloneI want my own home I want my own girl Help me hate the world Own and love my life,dead kennedys

Who wants to be Dinah Shore Who's alter-ego is Dinah Shore Oh, his fists didn't go up so quickly this time. Yawn...yawn..yawn. Put those headphones on, it's be-bop time.I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland. The night before we played at the Long Goodbye. I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night. A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night. And well, I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this bright blue pickup drove up. It had KC lights, tractor tires, everything but the CB. It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid, right. Well, they drove up to me and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell, ""Hey, faggot,"" and showered me with some water. So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock. Now, I waited, walked down about a block to where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside, and sure enough they drove around again. They said, ""Hey, faggot, where's the nearest McDonald's"" I said, ""I don't know"" and they squirted me again. So I threw the rock and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car. They screached to a halt in the parking lot of some department store, who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer, and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling, ""We're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot, we're gonna kill you, you motherfucker."" So I got in a phonebooth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside, held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door to the phonebooth. So they began charging the phonebooth, beating on it with their club, yelling, ""We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot."" I just looked at them. So, there was a crowd gathering by this time and these kids were standing nearby and they said, ""Oh, look at him, he's insane."" I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out. I yelled at them, ""Take me to a mental hospital right away. I wanna be be put away. Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away. Please put me away now."" They said, ""Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."" So they called the police. The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks. He opens up the door, ""Get out of there, you,"" throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back. Then he goes over to the jocks, ""Now what happened here It looks like we're going have to take him to jail but we got to have the full story first"" So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole Take down on the bass, a little bit down on the bass. Yeah, ace in the hole, and they go, ""Well, goddammit, the motherfucker put a dent in my truck, a $5000 truck, right, so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him. I want to kill him. Let me kill him, goddammit. Let me kill him."" So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home, and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence. And I thought, so this is Oregon, huh Tolerent OregonRay, are you done with your guitar yet He isn't done yet. So what else do you want to hear, I'm out of stories. That's a true story, too.

"Greetings:This is the Secretary of War at the State Department of the United States We have a problem. The companies want something done about this sluggish world economic situation Profits have been running a little thin lately and we need to stimulate some growth Now we know there's an alarmingly high number of young people roaming around in your country with nothing to do but stir up trouble for the police and damage private property. It doesn't look like they'll ever get a job It's about time we did something constructive with these people We've got thousands of 'em here too. They're crawling all over The companies think it's time we all sit down, have a serious get-together- And start another war The President He loves the idea! All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro Napalm People running down the road, skin on fire The Soviets seem up for it: The Kremlin's been itching for the real thing for years. Hell, Afghanistan's no fun So whadya say We don't even have to win this war. We just want to cut down on some of this excess population Now look. Just start up a draft; draft as many of those people as you can. We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on, hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use an automatic rifle and send 'em on their way Libya El Salvador How 'bout Northern Ireland Or a ""moderately repressive regime"" in South America We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story in the Middle East-we need that oil We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Khadafy's hit squad didn't even show up. I tell ya That man is unreliable. The Kremlin had their fingers on the button just like we did for that one Now just think for a minute-We can make this war so big-so BIG The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this right. Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls Now don't worry about demonstrations-just pump up your drug supply. So many people have hooked themselves on heroin and amphetamines since we took over, it's just like Vietnam. We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong. Kept the war functioning just fine It's easy. We've got our college kids so interested in beer they don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again. Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, they wouldn't even know what it looked like So how 'bout it Look-War is money. The arms manufacturers tell me unless we get our bomb factories up to full production the whole economy is going to collapse The Soviets are in the same boat. We all agree the time has come for the big one, so whadya say! That's excellent. We knew you'd agree The companies will be very pleased.",dead kennedys

"""In lonely gas stations with mini-marts You'll find rows of them for sale Liquor-filled statues of Elvis Presley Drink like a vampire His disciples flock to such a fitting shrine Sprawled across from his graceless mansion A shopping mall Filled with prayer rugs and Elvis dollsAnd I wonder Yeah I wonder Will Elvis take the place of Jesus in a thousand yearsReligious wars Barbaric laws Bloodshed worldwide Over what's left of his mythA growing boy needs his lunchWhen pesticides get banned we're safe up north We just sell them to those other countries Soon there's lots of exotic deformed babies Somehow that's not our faultJust dip 'em in glaze paint 'em orange and green For the Arizona roadside stands To sell alongside plaster burros and birthbathsAnd I wonder Yeah I wonder Why so many insects around us feed off the deadDeath squads Starvation Foreign aid? Just leave it to the magic of the marketplaceA growing boy needs his lunchEveryone should just love each other Dip your toe into the fire Drop your guns and lawsuits and love each other Life begins beyond the bunker And while you're busy hugging in the streets Outgrowing your hatred for all to feel Jiminy Cricket's found a game to play Stick your neck out and trust'It'll be chopped away Jimmy through your locked front doors Rifle through your sacred drawers Line my pockets Deface your dreams Til the cows come home to meNibbling like an earwig winding through your brain Bound like Lawrence Harvey spreadeagle to a bed The migraine gets worse when we find out we lay eggs And no one in all of Borneo can hear you screamTurn on Tune in Cop outDrop kick Turn in Tune out""",dead kennedys

Cold concrete apartments Rise up from wet black asphalt Below them a few carcasses Of the long gone age of privacyIt takes a scary kind of illness To design a place like this for pay Downtown's an endless generic mall Of video games and fast food chainsOne by one The little houses are bricked up and condemned A subtle hint to move Before the rats move inThis could be anywhere This could be everywhere Those new kids at school seem cool But dad says not to talk to them Stick to your old friends They're not our kind So now there's lots of fightsSo many people I know Come of age tense and bitter-eyed Can't create so they just destroy C'mon! Let's set someone's dog on fireEmpty plastic Culture slum suburbia Is a war zone now Sprouting the kinds of gangs We thought we'd left behindThis could be anywhere This could be everywhere Kids at school are taking sides Along color and uniform lines My dad's gone and bought a gun He says he's fed up With crime in this town This could be anywhere This could be everywhere This could be anywhere This could be everywhere Anywhere Everywhere I hope I'm gone before it explodes I linger late at night Waiting for the bus No amount of neon jazz Could hide the oozing vibes of death My dad's a vigilante now He's bringing home these weird-ass friends Like the guy who fires blanks at his TV When Kojak's on Or the guy who shows off his submachine gun To his sixteen-year-old daughter's friends Whose sense of pride and hope Is being in the police reserveThis could be anywhere This could be everywhere-Everywhere,dead kennedys
"Jesus was a terrorist Enemy of the state That's what the Romans labeled him So he was put to deathHe died for his beliefs What's changed today?Today bible-thumping cannibals Reap money from his name Buy cable networks & power With old ladies' checksIf Jesus saw Pat Robertson What do you think he'd say? Tax free then re-write our laws And sick 'em on you Women don't control their bodies TV preachers doCensor everything from bathing suits To science books From the schoolroom to the bedroom They want our thoughts - or elseThey treat us like the Romans Used to treat the Christians Even some church-going folks are scaredModern catacombs of fear Built with money, power, and threats Rock 'n Roll is labeled porn Sell a record, you're under arrestInstead of fighting AIDS They try to stop us having sex They brag that they won't quit Till they take dominion over our livesIs freedom of speech such a terrorist act Is spiritual peace such a satanic threat Believe what you want But we'll fight to keep Our heads from being cemented in your sand",dead kennedys
