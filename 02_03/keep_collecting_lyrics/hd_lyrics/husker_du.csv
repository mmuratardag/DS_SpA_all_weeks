"Pass away the hours, hear the footsteps of the past Walking up the stairs of time, knowing that I'm trapped Cold winds of indifference persuade a movement south Thinking that it's better there The warmer climes that we seek outPoor bird flies up in the air, never getting anywhere And how much misery can one soul take? Trying to fly away might have been your fist mistake Poor bird flies up int he air Never getting anywherePicking petals off a flower, loves me, loves me not Is love another way to count the things you haven't got? We wish the best to all our friends, young and old alike When the dust has settled in the sky, you can have anything you like",husker du
Walking down a sunny street to the library Checking out the latest books on outer space Going to the fruit stand to buy a dozen oranges Then she and the books and the oranges go back to her placeShe tells the same old story to everyone that she knows She's just sitting in her room reading books about UFOsSometimes I see her sitting on the rooftop Perched in a lawnchair and staring into the sky I know that somewhere in some faraway galaxy That some gray men with telescopes are gazing right into her eyesHer live revolves around all of the planets And she is constantly aware of all the changes that occur I'm going to turn into a lens and focus all my attention On finding a new planet and naming it right after her,husker du
"Avalanche looms overhead Airplane flies overhead Important man sits by the window Sucked out of the first class window Images run by, thousand miles an hour But the time seems far away Folding clothes in a folding closet Folding money in a resumeTime to let off some pressure Time to let off some steam All your notebooks get thrown away And you start your diary clean Crystal glass lined up in a row Watched over by the G.I. Joes Sugar in your coffee doesn't taste quite right Feeling the effects for a hundred thousand nightsWhen civilization falls in its grave Technology throws on the dirt You realize the finest things in life Are the ones that can never be hurtShatters your brain in a million tiny pieces The sounds you hear aren't coming out right You think it might be mystic, you think I might be cryptic The crystal in your china case is breaking in a million tiny pieces",husker du
"She gave her little child a name A ward of welfare she became And then one day she met a man Digging through the trash for cansCharity, chastity, prudence, and hopeIt was his aluminum That attracted her to him And quite a day there did unfold Turning garbage into goldCharity, chastity, prudence, and hopeShe took that money in a trunk And bought a bunch of worthless junk And now they're back where they began Digging through the trash for cansCharity, chastity, prudence, and hope",husker du
"Could you be the one they talk about? Hiding inside, behind another door? Is it only happiness you want? Does wanting a feeling matter any more?It doesn't mean that much to me Sometimes I don't mean that much to you And I don't even know what I'm hiding forAnd I don't even know what I'm crying for Don't even know what I'm hiding forCould you be the one they talk about? Life is a game that only you can make Maybe I'm about to throw it out I've given it all, that's all I can takeCould you be the one Could you be the one Could you be the one that's hanging all aroundDon't even know what I'm hiding for Don't even know what I'm crying for Don't even know, could you be the only Broken hearted one",husker du
"I picked up my belongings in a nylon carry-all I hear the porter call Said  The sky's the limit on this chartered trip away, I guess I'd better stayOut there on the desert, I see trees on every wall Nothing's ever solved Said  The sky's the limit on this chartered trip away, Guess I'd better stay awayI thought I owed myself a trip away I wanted to go to places I have never been away I looked at the pictures, imagine where they lay Away on a beach by the sand, where their clothes all lay awayHorizon is oblivious, chartered trip away Said  There's no returning from this chartered trip away.",husker du

"Love and hate was in the air, like pollen from a flower Somewhere in April time, they add another hourI guess I'd better think up a way to spend my time Just when I'm ready to sit inside, it's summer time Should I go swimming or get a friend to hang around It's back to summer, back to basics, hang aroundGetting drunk out on the beach, or playing in a band And getting out of school meant getting out of handWas this your celebrated summer? Was that your celebrated summer?Then the sun disintegrates between a wall of clouds I summer where I winter at, and no one is allowed thereDo you remember when the first snowfall fell When summer barely had a snowball's chance in Hell?",husker du
"I look at your house I wonder what goes on inside When you have to cry yourself to sleep at night Your parents fight You don't know who's wrong or right Have to cry yourself to sleep at nightA broken home, a broken heart When the two of them will have to part Broken home, broken heart Now you know just how it feels To have to cry yourself to sleep at night",husker du
"Got something to say like something to me well just go ahead and spit it out It's all the same, you see What's that, it doesn't make sense Are you talking in tongues or is your brain out of gear I can hear it rattle in your headI can see you lips move Blah Blah Blah but all I hear isGot something to say Like something to me Well just go ahead and spit it out It's all the same, you see It's coming out better but it doesn't make sense Is that a head on your shoulders or something you use for ornamentation",husker du

"I can walk the bed of nails I'm not the only one But some, they cannot walk the jagged line Callous, concentrating For nails are sharp as lies I run the jagged lineFrom years and years of practice I know just how to stand Alone with perfect balance, hand in hand Prepared with boards and hammers And several bags of nails I could build a wall to lean on Roof above my mind I can see you've got your own plans Please don't drive your nails into this heart of mineI can walk the bed of nails Grin and bear the pain But some, they cannot deal with all these things Always sacrificing For lies are sharp as nails And all the pain it bringsSometimes I just pretend that all the lies are true And I know I might depend on you But if my concentration breaks I'm washed away with pain And then my feet begin to bleed upon my only bed of nails And I'm stuck here in the middle of a sea of lies Inside my bed of nails",husker du
Now you look like you just got back from somewhere Somewhere yeah you know that it's true Together we went nearly to nowhere Nowhere really worth going to Standing at the city center In the middle of the winter I was waiting for you and you were dueWhen I got back you said you were leaving Leaving you said right away And coming back for the sake of retrieving Things you'd forgotten on that day Still now my eyes are burning With the sight of your returning Everywhere I look I'm finding you I remember youFamiliar places that we turned into gardens Somewhere yeah you know that it's true I'm begging you now a thousand pardons For all of the wastelands we've been through I remember asking whether Or where we could be together You smiled at me and you said soon,husker du
"When I was younger, worrying about it Trying to make these decisions for myself And I go on to ask myself what's right and wrong about it And I don't really know what makes it, ask yourselfNow I see you, you want to ask me I want you to ask me, I want you to ask me What does it matter?  What does it mean? Sometimes I don't know why you want to try and help me I get so confused I start to fall over backwards Then I ask this to myself, and see within myself And wonder what it means, and ask these questions to myselfNow I'm a little bit older And I'm not a hell of a lot wiser So I've gotta sit down and contemplate itShould I talk to the mirror, should I talk to a wall Should I even talk at all Would a little tiny bit of action Would it make it even seem to matter anymore I guess it matters just to youAll this I've done for you",husker du
"Got these little pills To curb your appetite Take a couple of these You'll be up all night I can scream, I can jump, I can shout I can tear the whole place down When I take a couple of these I don't want you aroundAll tensed up, did too many pills Wanna get near you but I can't stand stillBaby, I love you, but I'm too loaded To love you properly",husker du

Running around like an insane maniac Anywhere that you please Taking advantage of anyone handy To satisfy your diseaseYou're a soldierGoing off on a big adventure You never want it to end Saving up a million stories To tell to all your friendsYou're a soldierKnocking over everything that's standing in your way Can you tell me just how many did you kill todayYou're a soldierPatrolling the world with your little boy face And a grown up gun that shoots You got a fresh scrubbed teenage outlook on terror And a khaki attitudeYou're a soldier,husker du
"He lives in his imagination, with those friends of his very own He doesn't get along with the outside world, he'd rather be alone Sometimes, when it's late at night, he starts to wonder why (The plans he made can never happen, so all he does is cry).His parents, they can't understand why their son, he turned out wrong He runs away from all the pain and forgets them when he's gone He'd rather be all by himself because his plans, they seem the best. He finally gets the nerve one day and now life becomes a test.Mom and Dad, I'm sorry Mom and Dad, don't worry I'm not the son you wanted, but what could you expect? I've made my world of happiness to combat your neglect.",husker du

I'm down again And I don't know how to tell you But maybe this time I can't come back Because I might be too far downI wish for real That I could turn it on and off Like hot and cold and up and down Because I'm down againI'm too far down I couldn't begin to smile Because I can't even laugh or cry Because I just can't do itIf it was so easy to be happy Why am I so down? All I can do is sit and wonder if it's going to end Or if I should just go away foreverWhen I sit and think I wish that I just could die Or let someone else be happy By setting my own self freeAnd you don't want the emotion Because the taste it leaves is for real But nothing's ever real until it's gone And I might be too far downAnd is this just another thrown away Or is this the end of the whole stupid road But you wouldn't want to know how I feel anyway Because the darkest hole is at the end of the roadI'm down again And I guess I'm not the only one who dreams That there's not any way to tell you Because I might be too far down,husker du
"You never used to care for fancy new obsessions You never used to have a reason to be bored Now you indulge yourself with new ways of possession Now you indulge yourself and your feelings are ignored And you're coloring your life with too much spiceThere was a time, there was a place, there was a reason There was a situation comfortable for you You've tasted everything in this here bag of season But now you're bored and you've run out of things to do And you're coloring your life with too much spiceYou don't see anything your eyes are so revealing They're sharply focused on looking for a thrill You've turned so numb you never notice any feeling Your thoughts are dead and you've still got some time to kill And you're coloring your life with too much spice",husker du
"Several times I've tried Everything to make you feel all right (Turn it around) Is anything working? Several times I've died inside And then I see you get uptight (Turn it around) We gotta get back Turn it aroundI've got time on my side And you've got time on your side Now it's only time to decide Which side you're on We've tried everything in sight To make it turn out all rightNow is the only time Now is the only time Now it's time to try to turn it aroundSeveral times I've wished That everything would slip into a void (Turn it around) Does it even matter now? It's time to figure out The things we want, and things that we'll avoid (Turn it around) We gotta get back Turn it aroundI don't grab for straws anymore And you don't sink your claws anymore But the more I think The less I really know about myself We gotta turn it around Before it goes into the groundSeveral times tried to turn it around Several ways tried to turn it aroundThere's several morals and there's several plays Several parts that anyone can try It's enough to make you cry I may not think that I'm right But I know the things I've got Are gonna turn out all right We gotta get back, turn it aroundI may not be anything And you might be the biggest thing But the biggest thing to me Is making this thing work for life We gotta turn it around Before it goes into the ground",husker du
If there's one thing that I can't explain Is why the world has to have so much pain With all the ways of communicating We can't get in touch with who we're hatingSo turn on turn on turn on the newsI hear it every day on the radio Somebody shoots a guy he don't even know Airplanes falling out of the sky A baby is born and another one dies Highways fill with refugees Doctors finding out about disease With all this uptight pushing and shoving That keeps us away from who we're _loving_,husker du
"Well, you get up every morning And you see, it's still the same All the floors and all the walls And all the rest remains Nothing changes fast enough The hurry, worry days It makes you want to give it up And drift into a hazeRevelations seems to be another way To make the days go faster anywaysWe're all exchanging pleasantries No matter how we feel And no one knows the difference 'Cause it all seems so unreal You'd better grab a hold of something Simple but it's true If you don't stop to smell the roses now They might end up on youExpectations only mean you really think you know What's coming next, and you don'tYearbooks with their autographs From friends you might have had These are your important years You'd better make them last Falling in and out of love just like...

There's a girl who lives on Heaven Hill I go up to her cabin still She keeps a lantern lit for me And a bottle up on her mantelpieceShe's the girl who lives on Heaven HillShe's got a big room and it's always a mess Worn out shoes and a worn out dress A worn out smile that she'll wear some more And a worn out welcome mat by her doorI'd trade big mountains and rooms full of gold For just one look at the beauty of this woman's soul Up on Heaven Hill is where I wanna be That girl that bottle that mattress and me,husker du
"I see you walking down the road And the thoughts within my mind explode But having to hold back taught me a lot about control And letting it all loose at once when it was time to let you know You occupied my space and you occupied your mind By jumping off the roof to the first conclusion you can findNow all the silver you can steal Can't buy a piece of what I feel It's sad but the means they just don't justify the ends To be forever haunted by the ghosts of all your friends Painful, yeah that's the way you've chosen it to be C'mon man can't you think of anyone besides me?These are the termsNow don't think you're the only one who is harbouring a self hate I'm just as guilty of selling what my own sweet soul creates Now don't feel bad the next time my memory comes creepin' You've got your own bed now, I suggest that's the one you sleep inGoodnight baby",husker du
I see the sun and I see the calendar The days go floating by so slowly in a blur I read the numbers and I discard everyone I burn my fingers on the pages of the sunI'll tell you why tomorrowMoonlight pulling all the water to the beaches Soaking time into everything that it reaches Turn it upside down and count the spilling sand Seize the moment with a minute handI'll tell you why tomorrowMen and animals are floating through the sky Every month or so a new one passes by Forming circles 'round the planets in the air Find a newspaper and it is printed thereI'll tell you why tomorrow,husker du
