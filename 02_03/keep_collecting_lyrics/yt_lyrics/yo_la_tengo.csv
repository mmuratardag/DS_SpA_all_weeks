"In crowded bars, at subway carsWhenever you are next to me, center of gravity, can't feel both feet on the groundWalking home after dark, past the softball parkIt's clear to me, according to a rule I learned one day in school Basic geometry: two halves of a circle, you and meIt's a familial song we've known so longYour clever cuts into me as long as you're next to me I can't feel both feet on the ground",yo la tengo
"Locked in a kiss, outsiders cease to exist We'll shut it out (of the fist) Outsiders cease to exist We'll shut it outEight o'clock, the lights are on at Shea Phone turned down, we've nothing much to say Dozing off the TV drones House key makes them turn and glance for homeLocked in a kiss, outsiders cease to exist Flayed of the fist Outsiders cease to exist We'll shut it out",yo la tengo
"When I heard the knock on the door I couldn't catch my breath Is it too late to call this offWe could slip away, wouldn't that be better Me with nothing to say, and you in your autumn sweaterI tried my best to hide In a crowded room, it's nearly possible I wait for you, oh, most patientlySo I looked for your eyes And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them I'll try hard, I'll try always But it's a waste of time It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily Like in the beginning In the beginning...",yo la tengo
"I will go if you say you'll go do you want to go I won't talk at all but I'll go for a ride I will go if you just let go do you want to go Is it all because of the time I took your advice I will go if you still want to go do you want to go And I will show what you want me to show do you want to know Until there's nothing left in the world to show you Only go where I don't know do you want to go You don't talk at all, but it's alright Feeling bold but your nose is cold like it's make of snow Is it all because of the time you took my advice If you put your hand in my palm I won't let it go Until there's nothing left in the world to make meSummer steaks and summer stays too long Autum comes and all of the sudden it's gone Tiny birds sit patiently Side by side on a wire Darker days and leaves in shapes so true Wind unfolds on nights so black their blue Tiny birds fly silently Side by side in the sky Don't be sad when it's time to say goodnight I'll be there to make sure that you sleep tight I'm your friend when you need a friend Until there's nothing left in the world to make you cry",yo la tengo
"Come along with me to my little corner of the world Dream a little dream in my little corner of the world You'll soon forget that there's any other place Tonight, my love, we'll share a sweet embraceAnd if you care to stay in my little corner of the world We could hide away in my little corner of the world I always knew that I'd find someone like you So welcome to my little corner of the worldAnd if you care to stay in our little corner of the world We could hide away in our little corner of the world We always knew that we'd find someone like you So welcome to our little corner of the world",yo la tengo
"Driving in the south, the motor's on fire Let's put it out, before the flames go higherMonday matinee, in pull we are life's throb So hard to choose between conceit and rockSome college in the spring, the sound is all wrong Reset the mate to our Flamin Groovies songDriving, night again, they're late, car crash We'll turn to look unless we're going too fast",yo la tengo
"i followed you   ..foolishly you were at a smoky bar, you were out til three sat alone inside my car, it was nearly four we were gonna wait for you all night so i locked the doori was gonna spend the night, coulda been okay we were gonna talk all night, till i went away remember how you used to say, can't stay up late a minute later we're older now, i can't stay awake i'm driving by your parent's farm, in the Chevrolet i remember that rusty car, like it was yesterdaysaw my brother driving by, the other day i wished that i'd go out to him, but he drove away saw my sister standing there, standing in rain then i thought about nothing, that it feels the sameanother day, come and gone don't think i can ever sing that song little secrets we bring along i'm taking my time, trailing behind, i thought of you today is the day i think of you",yo la tengo
"Not much Friday night, pinball, Lower East Side Walked halfway past and into the bar I used to think about you all the time I would think about you all the time Now it just feels weird, that there you are The damage is doneFeeling like a kid again, my eyes are glued to the floor I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door The damage is done",yo la tengo

"Talking words, angry words Hang in the air, we don't dare Sky went gray, wake in white Hangs in the air, we don't dareAnd there's a thousand reasons I don't need them to help the fired flare And even as we near it, I can't hear it Files in the air We don't dare",yo la tengo
As he fired up the drum machine He stole a glance at the empty seats He took a minute to retune his guitar As the hour grew lateI wanna send this out to Richie Vey In his thrift-store corner of the world His soul is my cheap laugh As the hour grows late,yo la tengo
"Scold me, that's all you've got to say Coldly hurt me and turn away You say I'm not sorry that I'm resolved to what is next I head for the shadowsHold me, taking it back in tears You've told me, slowly confessed your fears But I've got myself to protect It's too soon for me to forget I wait in the shadowsIn the shadows, where I end up loved They help me see that I've finally won We wait in your heartSo until I truly believe That your words convey what you mean I wait in the shadows I wait in the shadows I don't mind the shadows",yo la tengo
"Whatever you want from me, whatever you want I'll do Try to squeeze a drop of blood from a sugarcubeTry to be more assured, try to be more right there Try to be less uptight, try to be more aware Whatever you want from me, is what I want to do for you Sweeter than a drop of blood from a sugarcubeAnd though I like to act the part of being tough I crumble like a sugarcube for youWhatever you want from me, whatever you want I'll do I will try",yo la tengo
"What's the matter, why don't you answer What's the matter with me Cause it's so hard to be Free and easy, we'll disappear completely Hardly as I've known it's gladYou're heart is broken, and the doors are open As you're hoping to be There's brighter places to see Hands need warning, early in the morning Hardly as I've known a surpriseNo, don't warn me I know it's wrong, but I swear it won't take long And I know, you know, It makes me sigh; I do believe in loveAnother season, but the same old feelings Another reason could be I'm tired of aching, summer's what you make it But I'll believe what I want to believe",yo la tengo
"You tell me summer's here, And the time is wrong. You tell me winter's here and your days... Are getting long.Tears are in your eyes... tonight.You tell me that you haven't, Slept in days. You tell me sleeping only makes you tired... Anyway.Tears are in your eyes... tonight. Tears are in your eyes... every night.Althought you don't believe me you're strong.

Tears are in your eyes... tonight.",yo la tengo
"Do you need someone to hide behind Well I don't mind Well I don't mind Do you need to be alone to unwind Well that's alright That's alright Sure I know its hard Know that it's that way for everyone For every one Something go wrong Sing so low you even blame the sun You blame is at the cause Of the shadows on the wall They're not as bad as they appear Could it  be that it's the season of the sharkDo you need someone to help you through Well I don't know I don't know Someone to take questions with you I don't know I don't knowI want to be The one to make you feel okay right now Some way, some how So when I fall short I sink so low that I even blame the clouds For blocking out the sun And the shadows on the wall That's why you feel aloneCould it be that it's the season of the shark?Please don't be afraid No matter how much out there scares you so Scares you so Just look around If it's not me then someone else you know And I don't belong at all Ignore the shadows on the wall They don't mean a thing Could it be that it's the season I believe that it's the season of the  sharkCould it be that it's the season of the shark",yo la tengo
"Walking on 10th Street The guy in front of me, Walkman, headphones on, Stones cranked The thing that caught my ear, singing loud and clear Well every couple of steps I heard ""Woo-woo"" And he said it so un-self-consciously That never it would occur to me that He revealed himself and I'd offer a blueI was drunk the night we met, I might try to forget Except I know so were you I don't really care, cause we went on from there And I try not to hide from what is true The other night I had this dream You told me what you want from me I gave it to you instantly and I woke up without a clue",yo la tengo
"I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you We're going down to the auto shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do Get on the ride, no sweat, sure we'll take you anywhere you want me toFirst gear, it's all right Second gear, hang on tight Third gear, ain't I right Faster, it's all rightIt's not a big motorcycle, just a groovy little motorbike It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys, that two-wheel ride We'll go on into the hills or anywhere you wanna decideWe'll ride some hills like a champ because my Honda's built really light When I go into the turn, lean with me, hang on tight I think I'll put on the lights, so I can ride mine under the night",yo la tengo
"Well, it's 1 PM again I guess I'm ready to begin And it's reeling, there is a feeling Let's not make any sudden movesYou don't have to show me how But I'm not ready to right now There is a feeling, and it's reeling Let's not make any sudden movesAnd if we don't leave today There's no hurry anyway I'm on the road here, safe at home here So let's make sure we're sure That it is reeling, and I'm feeling Let's not make any sudden moves",yo la tengo
"I may have been gazing out too late at night I see a deeper window into my eyes Every day they screech outside my window, The crashing cars never seem to collideSometimes when I'm staring out my window To catch the stars, I watch as they go by I've been getting messages from outer space They expire light in the window in the sky There goes my mindIf we dare walk onto my window I could hear them if I open my eyesSometimes flashing lights seem soulful in the window You may have seen them circle me at night I keep sending signals into outer space They expire by your window in the sky There goes my mindEvery day when restlessness takes over me I can't see it as I'm closing my eyes I keep sending signals into outer space They expire light in the window in the skySometimes when I'm staring out my window To catch the stars, I watch as they go by I've been getting messages from outer space They expire light in the window in the skyBy your window in the sky",yo la tengo
"Come won't you walk with me Griselda, wearing the dress that moonlight shines through. I am a sad and lonely boy , since your mother said I couldn't see you.Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night, calling to the moon out yonder O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.Do you recall last night Griselda? Learning the lessons nature taught us. Watching the fish up the lake, it was lovely till your mother caught us.Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night, calling to the moon out yonder O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.Moonflower find upon the window, give me a foothold for my finding. I've got a row boat on the lake. Fishing around and all the sun was shining.Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night, calling to the moon out yonder O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.I've got a jug of wine Griselda. Why must you waste your time in sorrow? Hold out your hand; have no fear. If we're caught, I'll marry you tomorrow.Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night, calling to the moon out yonder O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night, calling to the moon out yonder O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.",yo la tengo
"Oh no, I think I'm falling for a false alarm Like an all-day second stuck Until you crunch the right arm Well if I open my eyes, if I just pay attention to McNew Well, I just held back To listen to your cues So it's not enough I never meant to hold you down Waiting for the firestorm Waiting for the false alarmWell, is it really true? Well, I know, I mean I guess, uh, why not Well is it really true, I don't know, Too hard to figure out I'm gonna mark my words, cross my eyes and stomp my feet Cause I don't want you feeling bad, feeling bad, feeling Worse than you do Well, I'll stand my ground, hide behind a fake smile Think I'll talk about something else Just for a little whileAw, said it once, said it twice, said it - you can tell it's the same old tune Straight down to the bitter end Tell me when there's more to go there soon It's gonna hold my tongue in place, think about what to do If you don't see nothing wrong this time Well I'm taking it out on you",yo la tengo
