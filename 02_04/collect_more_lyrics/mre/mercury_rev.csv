"wanna ask but I just stare can I run my hands through your carwash hair (2x) drillin a hole with my soul in the sand diggin for gold for the whore, in the bed catchin a ride with a band I sat in the back of the van they tried to make me understand that if I'm not in a band, doesn't mean I'm square and if I am well then I don't care wanna ask? (2x) number two has got me confused hope I'll always be numbers one and three (2x) wanna ask? (2x) drillin a hole with my soul in the sand diggin for gold for the whore, in the bed catchin a ride from a band I sat in the back of the van they tried to make me understand that if I'm not in a band, doesn't mean I'm square and if I am well then I don't care wanna ask? (2x) what the hell but I don't care you can run your hands through my carwash hair wanna ask but I just stare can I run my hands through your carwash hair (3x)",mercury rev
"And where we go from here, is anybody's guess, These thoughts I've got inside, ain't easy to confess, My hand upon my heart, I draw a little breath, cos I've fallen down, (down, down, down...) And I bleed and I feel that it's all too real, On a wave of emotion sending ships across yer ocean, And I've lost all my reasons...but it's you I can...believe inAnd looking in your eyes, the stars they fall away, And holding to your hand I waste away the day, I've got to make it known, I've got to let you see, But I'm not so strong...And I bleed and I feel that it's all too real, On a wave of emotion sending ships across yer ocean, And I've lost all my reasons...when it's you I can...believe inBelieve in, believe in, ohh Believe in, believe in, ohhNo I'm not that strongAnd I bleed and I feel that it's all too real, On a wave of emotion sending ships across yer ocean, And a way of feeling that inside I know I'm healing, All these waves of emotion sending ships across yer ocean, And I've lost all my reasons...but it's you I can...Believe in",mercury rev
"Has she found a way to make her man work out rite, An' has she found a way to let her man into her life,Has she found a way to teach her man some control, Oh to make him understand her, as a whole, Will she find a way to tell him just how lost she is, An' will he find a way to lead her out of the wilderness,Take her by surprise, and not by force, Oh able to withstand, all her storms,In the wilderness..things aren't what they seem, In the wilderness..life is but a dream, That flows on..that flows on...Will he find a way to let her play such a sacred role, Will she find a way to forgive him as a whole,Oh how can he have been so blind for so long, An' how can the woman I love, be so strongIn the wilderness..things aren't what they seem, In the wilderness..life is but a dream, That flows on..that flows on...",mercury rev
"An unseen force behind the turning leaves, Drives them all vermillion and green, You never gave up on me somehow, I don't know why I haven't turned by nowOoh I know love sounds impossible, Some words are just so hard to say, And there's times you feel unlockable, An' all you ever want, Is someone to try...to open up...and find a way in Don't ever say you were wrong for me, For you were always strong enough for three, I never let you in my world somehow, I'm asking you to please, allow me nowOoh I know love sounds impossible, Some words are just so hard to say, And there's times you feel unlockable, An' all you ever want, Is someone to try...to open up...and find a way inTruer skies beyond the swirling clouds, The other birds are off and flying south, We'll have to make our own way there somehow, An' I'm asking you to please trust me nowOoh I know love sounds impossible, Some words just take so long to say, And there's times you feel unlockable, An' all you ever want, Is someone to try...to open up...and find a way inSomeone to try...want someone to try, want someone to try, want someone to try...",mercury rev
"Ain't it amazing when the seasons begin, to change, Someone behind the scenes just seems to pull some strings, I've struggled with an old angel all night long, An I thought it might be nice if we just talked till dawn I never never gave you...enough I could've given you...my loveThey say that mary magdelene, had it real bad She took her baby and she headed, off to france New situtuations don't present themselves, at first If I was her I don't know where or to who I'dve turnedI never left you with...too much I could've given you...my loveI hear of people living deep inside of, the earth They got their own sun and some claim they were here first I've struggled with an old angel all night long I thought it might be nice if you stayed here till dawnI know I left you...alone too much But I know I need you here...my love I never thanked you...enough I could've given you...my love",mercury rev

"She has a way that is beautiful to behold, Movements of silence and calm, A universe of life folded up inside her, A symphony of strangeness and charmAn she knows Every now and them there's an ocean of silver, Concealing herself as a stream, Scars in her life that she once tried to hide, Healing themselves as she breathesAn she knows What she knowsFeel yerself arise Feel yerself arise Y' let yerself go An tell yerself you'll know when you knowShe has a way that is beautiful to behold, An every now and then you can see, A universe of light splashed in her eyes, Revealing the only light she needsAn she knows What she knowsFeel yerself arise Feel yerself arise Y' let yerself go An tell yerself you'll know when you know",mercury rev
If I was a white horse...an offered you a ride... Thru a black forestIf we took a strange course...promised you a danger...

"Lover lift me up, high enough, To see the star of gold in the heart of the climbing rose,An how she knows, what to hold, An what to leave behind, but close And how come I don't How come I don't Lover let me see Where she finds The strength to rise Above the weeds and other plants And how come I can't How come I can'tLover lift me up... Oh come and lift me upLover let me go, Let me see, Just how it feels, to bloom, all by yourself, Oh I know I can, Oh you know I canLover lift me up... High enough... To see the star of gold in the heart of the climbing roseLover lift me up... High enough... To see the star of gold in the heart of the climbing roseLover lift me up...Lover lift me up...(lover lift me up) Lover lift me up...(lover lift me up) Lover lift me up...(lover lift me up...)",mercury rev
Down poured the heavens Down fell my loveThe brightest of beings Cast from above When into my darkness I praise the god sublimeWho let this fallen angel into this world of mine,mercury rev
"On a summer day you can hear her call, But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall, On a summer day you can hear her call, But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall, Thru the fields an the streams an the lakes an the trees, An the grass an the logs run all my dogs, And I am home againIn the autumn air, You can see her smile, But in a funny way she reminds you of a child,In the autumn air, You feel her soul unfold, And in a funny way you feel your own explode,Thru the fields an the streams an the lakes an the trees, An the grass an the logs run all my dogs, And I am home againAhhhh Ahhhh Ahhhh AhhhhOn a winter day, You can hear her call, But in a funny way when the snow begins to fallOn a winter day, You can hear her call, And in a funny way, You love her even moreThru the fields an the streams an the lakes an the trees, An the grass an the logs run all my dogs, And I am home againThru the fields an the streams an the lakes an the trees, An the grass an the logs run all my dogs, And I am home againOn a summer day you can hear her call, But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall, On a summer day you can hear her call, But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall",mercury rev
"Everywhere you turn you are, surrounded by the sound, Of winter's song, Everything is frozen and, only the swans have chosen, To be strongThe skies are all a big commotion, somewhere the birds are all in motion (Yearning to be back) And home where they belong An the love you once thought, long faded out of view, Was there all along, and right in front of you, An look at you now you're flying..too You're flying tooSoon the dormant patient roots will show themselves as childish shoots, (Watered by the tears) Of a first-time mother's joyLil' streams of consciousness, they tumble over rocks they kiss, (Unafraid of who they are) Of what will happen nextAnd the love you once thought (you once thought), long faded out of view, Was there all along (all along), and in ways you never knew, And the birds you once thought (you once thought), long gone ahead of you you, They were there all along, and right in front of you, An look at you now you're flying...too",mercury rev
"Look how the sun, captured by the rain, Glimmers and falls, and lands in golden balls, Like a bracelet hung, from a spider's web, For me to show to you, like gifts, That you won't forget... For as long as you live...See how the rain, captured by the leaves, Shimmers and falls, and lives on in diamond balls, Like a necklace hung, over limb and branch, For me to show to you, like gifts,That you won't forget... For as long as you live...Watch how the stars, captured by the sky, Appear to die, before our eyes and live on, in other ways, Well tonite they're mine, for me to show, For me to shower you, like gifts,That you won't forget... For as long as you live... And you will always have... For I will always give them... To you",mercury rev
