We stuck out our hands, and met the winds.The girl falters as she steps down from the platform. She clutches her stomach, and begins to heave. The ticket-taker smiles, and the last car is ready.

W: Uh-huh L: At your place, what..um.. basically whats going on right now is, um.. we're sort of biding our time waiting for Neutral to get together to uh, you know, do our album and all this stuff.. W: Right L: And we decided we would like to try and release a quickie single, like as quick as possible, just like 2 or 3 songs.. and um, just do it as inexpensively as possible, and we were thinking about doing it in four-track or something like that. W: Right L: And you know I talked to you about these incredible four-track recordings that you were making and so, um, I was wondering if you were actually still interested in working with us on it and doing it at your place.. and you know, if the whole thing goes well, we could probably give you some cash and stuff if it comes out.. W: Right L: I mean, I'm not really sure what.. what the deal's gonna be, we're probably gonna be trying to do it as.. W: Right, inexpensive.. L: ..you know, completely cheap, yeah, like I think you can get a thousand singles for like around $400 or something like that.. W: Right L: and uh, so we're figuring out if we can afford to pay for a sleeve or just have 'em white or what... W: Fold em yourself (chuckles) L: What? Yeah, well that's.. don't laugh! That's exactly what.. W: Well i did it! L: You did? The Glorious Strangers one? W: Right, the cover cost me $28.. L: For how many? W: (chuckles) I still have boxes of them.. L: No, but I mean how many did $28 buy, a thousand? W: Yeah L: It did!? W: At least.. L: Incredible! W: But I had to fold it all myself L: Yeah but thats okay! Because the place where they sell you the singles wants $200 for like a black and white photo sleeve.. and that's a lot of money! W: Yeah (chuckles) L: You know, I mean if we're trying to do it inexpensively.. W: Right, this is the great inexpensive way. L: Yeah W: And you know, you can off-set.. you could put..do anything on the cover you want, basically L: Right, right W: I just got it.. L: Did you cut them to that proper shape and everything, with the little flaps and all that? W: Well I had it figured out.. L: Uh-huh W: You know when I centered the thing, that there would be flaps on each side and I just figured out how to do it.. and I had it down to like a four-thing procedure... L: Uh-huh W: ...and I got these gluesticks... L: Yeah, they're great! They're really great.. W: And you just go [makes gluestick noise], you know, and now, admittedly, you know, if they don't get sold, they fall apart in the store (chuckles) L: Oh god.. well we're gonna put them inside little plastic bags also I think.. so they don't fall apart.. W: Well you'll find that the plastic bags are expensive. L: Well Thurston said, like $25.. no wait, 25 for a dollar... so that would be like $40 for a thousand, that's not too expensive.. W: That's not too bad.. L: No I thought it was gonna be even more than that.. maybe you could even get them cheaper if you tried to buy a thousand, maybe you could get em for $30 or something like that... but I was really worried about the [tape cuts off]",sonic youth,indie

We did while the waters rose, licking our feet. It was fun and funny so we laughed.I loved the way she could laugh. So full bodied. When we hit the sky we were high over the rooves. A field of gnarled antennae coiling upwards. Waves and waveforms joining in a nice hot blast. So different from the boat.The cold silver sky opened for us, and we passed through. Last I saw of Jill she was heading backwards into the coils of the antennae, laughing, so beautiful. Saying she hadn't yet had her fill of the boys there and the electricity. Saying she wanted to plug in again and fry a bit.I said ""Watch the water love"". She kept laughing and shook her hair. She said ""I'd love to, right now, you know?""

Bad Religion: Back to the Known EP (Epitath EP1-BREP2, 1984) After their first album, as band members slowly drifted away, Greg Graffin gradually changed the direction of their music, eventually playing neo-psychedelic folsky songs that nobody seemed to like. After releasing the album Into the Unknown and a few tracks on compilations, the band finally broke up, Greg moved back home, and that appeared to be it for Bad Religion. Then, in 1984, Greg moved back to LA and he and Greg Hetson restarted the band. Although Greg's two original songwriting partners (Brett, the original guitarist, and Jay, the original bassist) were missing, it was still a reuinion of sorts and a return to straightforward punk rock (although a bit slower than their old music). Toward the end of the year, after playing a few shows, they went into the studio, with Brett engineering and producing, and recorded a new 5-song EP called Back to the Known, which most people nowadays know as tracks 21-25 on the  80-85  CD. This EP is also known as  The Slow Record  (although compared to Into the Known, and later albums like Recipe For Hate, it doesn't sound so slow...) The lineup was Greg Graffin (vocals), Greg Hetson (guitars), Tim Gallegos (bass), and Pete Finestone (drums). Sequence: Yesterday Frogger Bad Religion (Theme Song) Along the Way New LeafThe lyrics on this EP are essentially guesses; hopefully someone can correct my errors before they cause irreparable harm to the fabric of the universe....",bad religion,punk

Put those headphones on, it's be-bop time.I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland. The night before we played at the Long Goodbye. I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night. A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night. And well, I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this bright blue pickup drove up. It had KC lights, tractor tires, everything but the CB. It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid, right. Well, they drove up to me and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell, ""Hey, faggot,"" and showered me with some water. So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock. Now, I waited, walked down about a block to where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside, and sure enough they drove around again. They said, ""Hey, faggot, where's the nearest McDonald's"" I said, ""I don't know"" and they squirted me again. So I threw the rock and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car. They screached to a halt in the parking lot of some department store, who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer, and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling, ""We're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot, we're gonna kill you, you motherfucker."" So I got in a phonebooth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside, held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door to the phonebooth. So they began charging the phonebooth, beating on it with their club, yelling, ""We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot."" I just looked at them. So, there was a crowd gathering by this time and these kids were standing nearby and they said, ""Oh, look at him, he's insane."" I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out. I yelled at them, ""Take me to a mental hospital right away. I wanna be be put away. Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away. Please put me away now."" They said, ""Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."" So they called the police. The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks. He opens up the door, ""Get out of there, you,"" throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back. Then he goes over to the jocks, ""Now what happened here It looks like we're going have to take him to jail but we got to have the full story first"" So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole Take down on the bass, a little bit down on the bass. Yeah, ace in the hole, and they go, ""Well, goddammit, the motherfucker put a dent in my truck, a $5000 truck, right, so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him. I want to kill him. Let me kill him, goddammit. Let me kill him."" So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home, and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence.

Hell, Afghanistan's no fun So whadya say We don't even have to win this war. We just want to cut down on some of this excess population Now look. Just start up a draft; draft as many of those people as you can. We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on, hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use an automatic rifle and send 'em on their way Libya El Salvador How 'bout Northern Ireland Or a ""moderately repressive regime"" in South America We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story in the Middle East-we need that oil We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Khadafy's hit squad didn't even show up. I tell ya That man is unreliable. The Kremlin had their fingers on the button just like we did for that one Now just think for a minute-We can make this war so big-so BIG The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this right. Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls Now don't worry about demonstrations-just pump up your drug supply. So many people have hooked themselves on heroin and amphetamines since we took over, it's just like Vietnam. We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong. Kept the war functioning just fine It's easy. We've got our college kids so interested in beer they don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again. Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, they wouldn't even know what it looked like So how 'bout it Look-War is money. The arms manufacturers tell me unless we get our bomb factories up to full production the whole economy is going to collapse The Soviets are in the same boat. We all agree the time has come for the big one, so whadya say! That's excellent. We knew you'd agree The companies will be very pleased.",dead kennedys,punk

444,"Kristin: there was a girl named pike. Pike was different from the other kids in some ways. She had huge yellow teeth which jutted out from her face, Particularly when she was angry and curled her lips back. Her favorite food was oatmeal, gummy and sticky and glue-like. Actually, it was her only food. Pike's mother would try to feed her pop-tarts and fish sticks, But pike would calmly remove the offensive food and fix Herself a bowl of oatmeal which she would strap onto her Head with scotch tape, and then walk around the house While she ate, masticating wildly. Pike's manner of dress was odd. She refused to wear any shoes, But some ratty old platforms She'd found in the garbage. You couldn't tell they were ratty and old, though As she had covered them with tinfoil David: for these reasons alone, Pike was ostracized at school. The other children picked on her, Called her ?mary? and other names, Pulled her hair and stuff. It was difficult for them to accept her into the Peer group, given her idiosyncrasies. Pike was different. Often, her mother would have little fits, When she could take pike's strangeness no more, Ranting about ?what had she done wrong,? And ?how she could have raised her weird daughter differently,? And ?why did her weird daughter do this to her.? These fits had no effect on the girl however, Pike would merely place one hand aside each eye and stare directly ahead, Sometimes lending a swift kick in her mother's shin. Kristin: even the family dog, mike, Seemed determinedly against her. He was always nipping her feet And chasing her into rooms where she didn't want to be. But the last straw was the morning she woke to a pair of Aerobic shoes sitting by her bed. Accustomed to these minor intrusions, She stepped over them and reached for her ratty platforms. They were gone. At least they weren't where she left them. She called for her mother and inquired as to their location, But there was no answer, and there were no ratty platforms Anywhere in the apartment, only a pile of broken glass In front of the shattered living room window. And there on the sidewalk, four stories down, Lay here special tinfoil shoes in a tattered heap. David: as she swept up the glass fragments, Pike decided to leave. This was not a difficult decision, Given that mike was biting at her heels and barking very loudly. She leapt over the mongrel and had just enough time to grab some Provisions and some tape, before mike lunged. Pike ran barefoot into the elevator, panting. It felt good to leave. She hated the apartment and that stupid dog. In fact, she hated the whole city. But she loved her shoes, And even her yellow jutting teeth, No matter how unpopular they were at school. Pike walked barefoot out onto the street, Barefoot along the sidewalk, Scooped up her shiny, rumpled platforms And continued barefoot along the road. Kristin: as the noises of the city faded, She discovered a whole new world, A lot of green, and room for bird sounds. Cars didn't drive so fast, And children played happily. They didn't seem to be full of pop-tarts and fish sticks. On and on she walked, and soon came to a stream. On and on she walked through the stream, Against the current, her platforms dangling from her shoulder. As dusk gathered and night began to fall, The sounds of greenness enveloped her. She caught sight of that for which she had been searching: A big square entirely filled with grass. She then knew what she had been born to do. Calmly she stepped out of the stream and Into her shoes and walked towards it. She poured some oats right out of the packet, into the Bowl and taped herself to it. Slowly, she walked to the middle of the field, Looked up to the stars and masticated wildly.What blood type do you have? David: I don't know. I've never been-- I don't think I've ever-- Kristin: there are only a few. you could just say one. David: o",throwing muses,indie
