Why using a DB Server (like PostGres) is better than using a "simple database" like a CSV file:
1. Can handle data in much larger quantities. PostGres is compressing your data into binary format for you behind the scenes so it is super compact / light.
2. Querying is much faster. PostGres is written in C, which is a very fast language. Also don't need to waste time opening / closing files like you do with CSV files. With 3. 3. Database servers you can also do fancy stuff like creating indices for quicker querying.
4. DB Servers can be hosted anywhere. You can set up a DB server in the cloud so that multiple people can connect to it simultaneously.
5. DB Servers provide an interface for user management. For example you can create different usernames / accounts, and give different users different privileges / permissions.
