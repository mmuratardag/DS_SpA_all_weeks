# Week 1 Project: Gapminder

## (Modified) Replication of Gapminder Animation

This project was completed in week 1 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy.

See https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo for the original Gapminder.

Project notebooks are [here](gapminder_final.ipynb) and [here](gapminder_plotly_murat.ipynb)

All the data frames are is publicly available on the [Gapminder project website](https://www.gapminder.org/data/); I also relied on another Gapminder DataFrame that comes with ```plotly_express```

Below is my replication ...

... and here is a static plot showing the trend of life expectancy and fertility (from early 1800s till 2015).

The following is prepped with ```plotly_express``` -- code adopted from https://towardsdatascience.com/recreating-gapminder-animation-in-2-lines-of-python-with-plotly-express-2060c73bedec.

The following plotly animation shows the relationship between GDP per capita and fertility across time in three continents
