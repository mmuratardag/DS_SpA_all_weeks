"Eleven times a scapegoat It's not a hug, but a choke And you're not what I've been missin' I'll be damned before I listen to you Princess of distress, you're a princess of distress Everything you want and nothing that you need But somehow it all just fits in I'd climb your mind just to go wishing I guess there's no use really cuz Cuz there's nothing like a real thing Welling up in my throat I love you, you must know There's not much that needs fixin' I can't quit when I'm addicted I guess there's no use really cuz Cuz there's nothing like a real thing I guess there's no use really cuz Cuz there's nothing like a real thing",sebadoh,
"I arrived with the lie I've forgiven Didn't wanna live on the wrong side of though I couldn't leave, though you made me a victim Standing in the kitchen with the keys in my hand When you ride me with your eyes closed Are you fixed on a picture of a friend? I'm crystal-crossed, I still feel lost But I refuse to be your victim Are you in love with the boy or a drug? Are you high when he bends to hug you? When you're with him are you outta your head? Is he the ghost floatin' over our bed? When you ride me with your eyes closed Are you fixed on a picture of a friend? I'm crystal-crossed, I still feel lost But I refuse to be your victim...again I refuse to be your victim Thinking everything could be a lie And have to wonder if you're with him And when you ride, do you look him in the eye? And when you fuck him, do you look him in the eye? And when you ride, do you look him in the eye?",sebadoh,
"Fatal missy, daring you to kiss me Crystal Gypsy, light my fire Tonight I die to realize, I bury my shit deep inside I suck up all you think and I'm thirsty Convoluted hell run dry Fatal missy, daring you to kiss me Crystal Gypsy, light my fire When it starts to suck and I'm stuck here Carrying me far away I just send a wink to the trustee Check's in the mail, it's time to pay Freeze out, I squeeze out something To stumble out, stumble down It's my kinda highway, really Convoluted hell run dry",sebadoh,
"What's all this commotion? You can break the alarm Restrain, please, don't bite me on the arm Capricorn Rising Diligent, she waits Bright eyes wink Future wife in a mini-skirt Buying me a drink, I abandon every plain Not your Mr. Right Committed like a burglar, arrive in style Nailed a warning sign Oh, when we get into square land, you'll get your little fish (?) Reel that sucker in In this condition, the elixir is zog Concentrated salvation, a region squad The way in my skeptic, blinded by grog A clever decision, never am solved",sebadoh,
"It's time to live inside, but don't complain of need to hide The air is all-expendable and seizing over wind. Wander around the bend While we are trying to begin Vision of lifelong wasted meaning, explaining, please expand upon Clearing out the closets and nothing's what we need to build In the first place you're all right the way you are, the way you are Grabbing all success begins where you thought it would all end Don't complain, just clear away Take off your shades and put them away You're OK (X6) It's OK You're OK",sebadoh,
"I feed on you; you feed on me When we agree, it's good to be bold When you act frightened, I'll make you feel stupid Cuz nothing's more stupid than thinking I'm evil But if you smile then I'll smile, too There's nothing better to do I'm just me-- listen to me A old All-American original You're down in the mind And don't say I don't see You're treating me badly; it's pulling me downmind Can't bring me downmind, sorry-sack downmind You're not an only fully true sad man Though I may seem a flaming total bitch I'm a special friend I'm just me-- listen to me A old All-American original You're not the cool-cool You're just a scared fool Thinking I'm evil & sure of your sickness Sick just to follow; follower gutless Mistaken for goodness And pulling me downmind Down in the mind; you're sick in the soul You're treating me nicely; it's pulling me downmind I'm just me-- listen to me A old All-American original",sebadoh,
"Close the Venetian blind Shut out the light and say goodbye to you Soon I can see right through You're sitting here talking to Real eyes, pools of blue Making what you say the rule You make me dream of broken tools I need the Dramamine To be as crazy as your scene I know it's not a dream Don't know what you're telling me? It's like wasting everything On someone else's dream It's like wasting everything On someone else's dream Seems pretty crazy to me Seems pretty crazy to me Seems pretty crazy to me",sebadoh,
"You give faith to deadly snakes, retain the need for names Now burn your books for me Confusion must end, jarred-up sympathy I've been here, but you won't hear, what have you to say to me? Blood-crazed Vampires wear a straight face The love, hate Expression of your dead weight Oh, go back down and load up what you can't sell And you don't sound the same And there's no one around who cares what you say Oh, I wanna trust you; don't do that to me I'm right here without my fear And all I need to be Can't take a switch-hitting twist in the name game I made a mistake trusting you with what I make Crowd control, assume the role Mr. Pointy-shoes put a pen to your soul Crowd control, assume the role Mr. Pointy-shoes, put a pen to your... Blood-crazed Vampires wear a straight face All the love, hate Expression of your dead weight Dead weight",sebadoh,
"It's what they call switching lanes In the left hand driving in the right hand driving And it all seems the same I can't get enough and you can't set it up A big omission and a thin disguiseoooohhhhhhh And I was hoping for a nice surprise Down on my knees I was saying it and you wouldn't listen and it all can't go on I was getting higher; I was trying hard Oh, drag me down I need it Oh, drag me down Those suspicions are a waste of timeoooohhhhhhh And I was hoping for a nice surprise Feed our trouble well Learn to feel, I can learn to feel I can hate it Oh, drag me down Those suspicions are a waste of timeoooohhhhhhh And I was hoping for a nice surprise",sebadoh,
I waited for you No one helped me through I can't believe in you And nothing is true Following you around Shoveling through our problems I don't hate myself for being so dumb I'm totally back and you're doing that I can't fuckin' stand I can't fuckin' stand this confusing shit I can't fuckin' stand,sebadoh,
"Story of water stronger than a man Town crier: day of the dam! More than a hundred years ago The flood raged on fast and cold Smashed barrels and broken chests Bridgework carried along to rest Crisis; cry sister Crisis; cry sister It's been real; it's been nice sis I can't help with your crisis C. Graves riding double speed Clear the factories you all must flee One in a panic turned to face the wave Raised his arms; met his fate Still in the riverbed you can see The broken pieces of pottery Cry sis; cry sister Cry sis; cry sister Yes, I'm gonna miss your kiss But i can't go on like this I AM A TRIBAL CHIEF MY NAME DISORDER FLESH AND BLOOD A TANGO FLOOD The antichrist is sleeping",sebadoh,
"Did you think I was dead inside? There was no room to grow And if I loved you still, I didn't let it show I never left you, though I've always loved you And you were free to leave me If you didn't believe in me Dumped...don't mind me I didn't know what I had til it was gone In love; so scared...couldn't stay ClichÃ© I had a good time Remember the good times Before it had to happen Cracked our world wide open Dumped...don't worry about me It wasn't up to you to set me free There never is good time, so they say ClichÃ©, clichÃ©",sebadoh,
"Burning out the thoughts that once were true Can't help but wonder if I use you But oh, the time has come now that I've learned how To rip you into little shreds Til you're my little sleepy-head  oh  oooohhhhhhh Not looking up to anyone Except the moon and the sun Talking like some stupid war Can't go on no more Children playing in the dirt One of them gets hurt One start is easy to be sure What would I do (?)",sebadoh,
"I don't know how to sleep, I forgot how to eat But I hail to the command I took my only chance All I ever wanted is just to know what's up But when I try to fake it, I always fuck it up The basement is haunted, my heart palpitates I'm worried about something, my voodoo of the day It should be easy, but it's hard to give it up The way it used to be was just not happening enough Crocodile tears, six-packs of beer Denying, undenying But no one knows I'm here (X3)",sebadoh,
"You've been broken for a long time Swallowing what you deserve You think you're dirt, so it's dirt you suck I can't help Everyone is really hung up On who or what they want to fuck Sex is power for the moment Suck and burn your worthless need Shaft you move the in and out like dreamin' Body hears and words that don't mean shit Holy Communion is friction to scrape your soul Give and take; so real, but not quite whole But almost, so do it again You've been broken for a long time (X4) Swallowing what you deserve",sebadoh,
"Time to fake a miracle, memorized emotion Memorize lullaby; changin' the arranged deal Tell me every reason why, cradle my confusion Memorize lullaby; changin' the arranged deal I wish we were colorblind, we could heal ourselves I wish we were colorblind I wish I were invisible, I'd sink into myself Black and white and beautiful Why'd they make it ugly? Crackers in their camouflage, headin' for the hills Now it's time to close your mind cuz Mother Nature tells you to I wish we were colorblind, we could heal ourself I wish we were colorblind, kept it to ourself Colorblind, lullaby, haunted til I'm pacified Think it to myself I wish we were colorblind, we could heal ourself I wish we were colorblind and kept it to ourself Colorblind, lullaby, hold me til I'm pacified Singing to myself",sebadoh,
"Zone doubt, born to be alone Save the sermonette, there's no one home I ascend to make amends I think I know I was beggin' the police to let you go But I can't stop the clock Passed out to take in, let the unconcern begin Tell your suspicious dreams to the wrong guy Volunteer your beer to the blue sky Out of my mind, half of the time, confused All my patience are abused and everybody knows They found you on the floor in an ashtray by the door At your hotel, an infidel with e.s.p., a blind man Out of my mind, half of the time, abused All the patience are amused And everybody knows",sebadoh,
In the town where I was born Lived a man who sailed to sea So we sailed through the night In our yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine A yellow submarine A yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine A yellow submarine A yellow submarine,sebadoh,
"I'll have to think about it, it's what she said to me I'll have to think about it, all the time in the world to be When I sleep I dream about it I chew it when I eat After something I can't explain The court's adjourned in the big debate The way you are, that's the worst thing you could do Don't you know that's the worst thing? Fantasyland Come dig my art, I'm just rehearsing I'll have to think about it, it's what she said to me When you leave behind all the guts it takes Who will you be? The way you are, that's the worst thing you could do Don't you know that's the worst thing?",sebadoh,
"Hey girl, do you see the thing I see? I'm linking to a line looking your eyes at me Dumpy young thing, just reach in for something to reach for Baby, you're beautiful, baby, you sweet whitey peach whore There's a man Finger, fist; shaft to tip, mat to rug 'til you scream Horny young ape walking with not a stall as I sing No, I'm not the one I know that you're trippin' my way Bland and quite usual; swear it's a beautiful day (It is, it is)",sebadoh,
"Sometimes we walk hand-in-hand by the sea And we breathe in the cool salty air You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare Then your lips cling to mine It's wonderful, wonderful Oh, so wonderful, My Love Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill And we gaze at the earth and the sky I turn to you and you melt in my arms Here we are darling, only you and I For a moment to share It's wonderful, wonderful Oh, so wonderful, My Love The world is full of wondrous things, its true But they wouldn't have much meaning without you Some quiet evening I sit by your side And we're lost in a world of our own I feel the glow of your arms holding love I'm aware of the treasure that I own And I say to myself, ""It's wonderful, wonderful"" Oh, so wonderful, My Love",sebadoh,
"Burn my mind, let's burn some time together I need the taste of something strange I won't deny it if you don't deny it I won't leave here in shame It's not weak to give in Taste the bounds of natural rhythm A willing girl is hard to find The day you let me in I killed my only friend I've ruined everything this time Dirty boys get hit I should've waited forever (I should've known all along) I should've waited forever (I let it happen)",sebadoh,
"When you see him again Tell him everything that you told me Tell him that I'm still your friend And maybe you would like to see me again I'm willing to wait my turn to be with you But I still have a lot to learn about me And no one's sure if we should be together But oh, when I saw you again A beautiful friend, she opened up her heart and let me in No, I cannot lie to you I'm still in love with you, and I only wanna be with you So when you see him again Tell him everything that you told me We're more than friends and maybe we should start again Maybe you could love me again Cuz oh, when I saw you again A beautiful friend, she opened up her heart and let me in No, I cannot lie to you I'm still in love with you, and I only wanna be with you I only wanna be with",sebadoh,
"Try to keep her down beside, but last night I set her free Free to let her spirit fly, left my choking stare behind Maybe if her will could grow, she might feel the need to leave Dying in my shadow, doubting I could ever let her be herself A sinful reflection of me, will I ever set her free? My love has shut her up, break the spirit I don't understand Cuz even as we're walking hand in hand, my life cuts her up An evil way to build me strong, a sad judge and so uptight It's too bad I'm so hung up I ask a simple question when I know the answer right I ask me if I love her as I tell her it's all right But nothing in my life would fit, I turned into an idiot Vampire, draining her desire Vampire, smother her with love When nothing in her life would fit she came upon an idiot Vampire Vampire",sebadoh,
"Freak-girl named Heather, I'm on my way Countdown, puzzled; the absurd, crazed All I need to do is fall into your well Seduced by apparition, lower a spell Sweet princess plays games all day She knows the rules, needs you to play Eternal rosebud zooming down Red goat stands, water surrounds Glued to set, I can't take it all in Heather's amused; drillings begin Jumping up and down in this useless waste Fingers dance on the map in your FACE ""Agony abounds in dreams,"" so you speak Legends of torture rock you to sleep All engaged, transmit a code Mission execution, overload Cowering freezebag, take a shower to cleanse (?) Flowering demoness, 3D boss (?) Whirlpool sermon, I wish to stall Patterns consuming, why at all? I know sorcery, it's miserable I know violet teeth to pull Lost bitch hits the switch I don't give a hooooooooooot Vomit overflowing as ya charge in pursuit",sebadoh,
"I've been thinking all day, but I've got nothing good to say There's a war on my mind, let me leave it all behind Things we'll never share are hangin' heavy in the air With all the weird on the way, let me have a perfect day But paranoia's contagious; I'm coming down with it, too You better throw your trust on the fire first Before I do It's a world of demand, it doesn't stop to understand And it's of world in demands, doesn't stop to understand you If you're waitin' on me to tie you up, set you free You'll be waitin' all day, all I wanna do is play But paranoia's contagious; I'm coming down with it, too Better throw your trust on the fire first Before I do Before I do And if we wanna be happy, it's all here to be used But settin' the world on fire burns, I thought you knew You thought I knew We never knew We never ever knew We never knew We never knew",sebadoh,
Now that you have your doubts Will you always be looking for a way out? And if I convinced you to stay Two years or two days from now I'd live in fear of losing you Holding on and trapping you inside Now I understand I can't  I'll be OK Two years or two days from now Even though I love you more now always have what I'm wanting And now I'm wanting you But if you don't want me I'll have to set you free I'll have to learn to live without you Guilt is a stupid thing Don't let it make you stay Leave me if you're wanting someone else,sebadoh,
"See how we've taken all this sweet time to decide Watered that tree, watched it grow another 50 feet high Together, shared and strong Step right in Forever is not that long Let's begin Feel this connection like the earth underneath me I feel this connection if I'm here, there, or anywhere I stand Feels right, all poured down We'll see it through The future, the here and now Me and you And it's sweeping our childhood away Hand in hand, we set off on our own But Heaven's not ours, and truth could be a game we play Strip the branches bare, but the tree stands on its own See how much we've grown Pleasure takes its toll, people lose control everyday Hypocrites like us deserve a little trust along the way Together, shared and strong, we try again Forever is not that long Let's begin Let's begin",sebadoh,
"True hardcore is hard to find Takes the peaceful selfish kind To realize where the power lies in music The beauty may be hard to take Pray it's not the evil fake There's always time to change your mind And still be very true Always will be true Like evergreens in wintertime Or elks around are sleeping, dying True hardcore is forever young True hardcore is left undone Someone who has always known it Someone who has never lost it And as the others act so strange You've had the strength to never change I'm still a selfish asshole",sebadoh,
It was never my intention To blindly feed the boy/girl game I know romance isn't everything But I'm obsessing just the same Because today I don't feel worthy You seem so beautiful and strong These unsure hands could never soothe you Too afraid of doing something wrong And this confusion wears me down Until I feel like a nervous stranger And could I help you grow? I guess we'll never know Set up for a let-down These things happen all the time And I'm not longing to explore it again I'm too scared of what you'll find And this confusion wears me down But I'll smile when I'm with you Cuz there's so much we could do Together or alone I'm not afraid of being alone,sebadoh,
"Pick a habit you can trust We all need the reassurance Blanket stretched across the window A friend to walk you through it all That could change if I was angry But after all, it turns me on It made all my good decisions; even helped me write this song Back when I was young and clever Traced a pattern in the wood I thought I'd get my shit together Now I know I never could Cuz it's a pornographic sunrise Static curtains that draw on our lives But we still thrive, through every time But we still cry, through every dive But we still try Too old to apologize (X2) We're too old to apologize (X2) So pick a habit I can touch Be as happy as you should be Could we talk, is it too late?",sebadoh,
"All I need is one true friend I want total peace of mind To leave the hurting world behind I'm not scared; I swear I'm free It may collapse the fear That burns to bring the worst from me Much too smart to sound uptight Not to cheat what I deserve Nothing hidden and nothing wasted So far from dead, frustrated Too smart to ask for more This is all I've waited for Nothing hidden and nothing wasted Nothing past the love I've tasted It's wrong but right; magic change I finally hurt to live on up to this name Not right; it never changes When finally hurt to live on up to this thing",sebadoh,
"Is something missing in my touch, a tension tugging at my smile? If there's a right thing to say, I'm sure I missed it by a mile Swallowed in some detail, heavy in my blood I wanna hold you close, but I can't lift my arms up Is there a reason for this distance? More than the drug that floats my days A nervous bug in my system, it keeps me edgy and ashamed I've got a saint, never ever will forgive That never understood me but still tells me how to live It fits when I stretch and I stretch because I can I stretch until I'm sore and then I open up for more I do it out of habit, not addiction And if I give it up, clean out my blood Will I still feel bored and disconnected? If I do it all for love, will I ever give enough? Cuz you can never be too pure or too connected You can never be too pure or too connected You can never be too pure",sebadoh,
"Make it easy and I'll hold it against you I'm on a string dangled right in front of you Make it hard and I'll run away Keep tomorrow as I kill today Trying to figure just what I deserve Slashing lines all across the earth Patience only makes the dream come true Everything I see I hold to you Tell me, this is it The Truly Great Thing The love you've hoped to find Any doubt will simply wipe itself out As we're rising deeper the first and last time Lift me up and drop me down again Every day I feel confusion, pain Love is what we've all been waiting for Something powerful to smash it all apart Can't love if you're locked up tight The dream of perfection, nothing ever seems right All the world will tell you, ""You're all wrong"" Big big deal if you're wrong This is it The Truly Great Thing The love you've hoped to find Any doubt will simply wipe itself out To rising deeper the first and last time",sebadoh,
"It's a joke I play 3 times a day to sticky magazines Tired wrist and greasy fist, erotic sister scenes Bitter, unreal; too worn out to feel Resisting, grasping and never lasting And nulling out my pleasure So I never know what's real 3 times a day, 3 times I see Just how pathetic my need can be 3 times a day, 3 times I see Just how pathetic my need can be 3 times a day, 3 times I see Just how pathetic my need can be You got it, brother",sebadoh,
"Could I hold on, or should I hold on to you? Ask, I'll tell the truth; there's nothing I should hide And if I move to slow, if you're bored I need to know I'm weak to hide inside, to force what I don't feel If all we have is a question, there's no hope to find a future But something in me cries for you It feels too real this time I think I love you, though I don't know what love means Girl of my dreams, or a friend that one day leaves Could I trust this when I've lied to myself before? Will I do it all again to taste what I've imagined we could be? Look what I've become; this pressure that we feel In a world of possibilities, this may not prove real But could we give enough, backed against a wall? Too close to breathe, but too far to fall All I ever wanted was to feel you closer to me And it's sad to feel this resistance What once before had felt so free Let tomorrow bee I can't be so impatient Pushing every answer, when there isn't any question Let me feel good now And though this may have to end, I hope I'm always with you Honestly your friend I think I love you",sebadoh,
"You were right I was battling you, trying to prove myself I tried to bury you with guilt; I wanted to prove you wrong I've got nothing better to do than pay too much attention to you It's sad, but it's not your fault Self-righteous and rude I guess I lost that cool Tapping til I drive you insane I'm self-righteous, but never right So laid back, but so uptight Destroying your patience to tolerate me With all the negative spirit I bring Right, I was obsessed to bring you down Watching your every move Playing a little-boy game Always with something to prove Waiting to cut you down, making it hard to live With only one thing to do Cut me first, make it easy Now you will be free Now that nothing depends on me Tapping til I drive you insane Now you will be free With no sick people tugging on your sleeve Your big head has that ""more room to grow"" A glory I will never know A glory I will never know",sebadoh,
"You know she's lost her mind for good this time Every thought's dragged around with a weight behind She sees herself in need of repair Maybe someone'll help her lay her soul down bare If you see the patient never compromising Short of wonder, I wouldn't be surprised Her lilac breath reminds me of you She gives a sign, doesn't mind being stalked Tension dissolves, she's taking off her socks Draws in the sky, doesn't mind me at all Curls up and away then the line dissolves Without hesitation I sail the course Exploration, a supernatural force White eyes grow at what I detect Pulling us both into the pretend Glorious connection due to end Advertising innocence floating in the air Unearth the seed, blew it up and it scattered everywhere",sebadoh,
"Come on girl, tell me something Tell me something I don't know Little girl, should I be scared the way I am? Does it feel OK to stand so close to me? Take my hand, try to walk in time together I'm doubting it could ever be that real Can't be sure, cannot rest inside worlds Either one could change tomorrow Then they'd see that none bear hurt It isn't fair; it can't be worth the pain Last time together Only falling deep inside yourself again",sebadoh,
"Little man, you are too impatient to understand This hateful world It's twisting you right through another girl Please slow down Let's help to find the secret of yourself Please believe you owe it to yourself to worship me I know a mystery or two A natural order always leaves a place for you I choose to gather strength from most what I see I live to give to you, but you don't give enough to me Remember this:  I possess a subtle holy gift I'm always here; never changing, scared, and half-sincere I'm obsessed to share with you the noise that I love best Let me in, then we'll sing together just like friends Doooo do do do do doooooo",sebadoh,
"Close my eyes Feel the fire Overwhelming fear and desire (so hard for you to stem the tide) Wavering heart, the flames growing higher (grab your bottle get your coat and hide) Lose what I have To test new water My mind is awash 'round the thoughts of her (so hard for you to fill my eyes) So much at stake, can't stay awake (temptation for me and for you) Drifting off (out with the tide) Dreams come so easily Filled with wasted fantasy We're together until the tide (so hard for you to stem the tide) Time enough to quell the day (test the water, there's the place, fill your heart) Tide's going out, here I am to stay (temptation tide)",sebadoh,
"Spoiled children soon to fall Freedom is the lie we live We will wait for tragedy And scatter helpless to the fire Sorry for ourselves Sorry for the things we've seen No one cries for help Waiting for the fire When all our toys are burning All these empty urges must be satisfied Acted outside Precious strength to turn the game to history Giving up, I'm blown away He said all I had to say The final days have come and gone Safe inside; there's nothing wrong Nothing in these words Sorry force of habit Could it be way over my head? Helpless to describe it Could it be way over my head? Helpless to describe it Could it be way over my head? Helpless to describe it Dumb & cruel Cut before it's grown Lies so forced in bored control It learned all that it cares to know",sebadoh,
"In blase and dream away Nothin' grew, so mark it bland (?) I'm sad, fuck sad, I'm teary-eyed Want a lovey-dovey honey, that's what I like I'm the finest drifter you'll ever meet I'm the kindest drifter you'll ever meet Don't think nothin' cards condemn I'm sure we both cut and shuffle them I cry cuz I'm drunk, plead cuz I'm down Gravity immune, yeah, I didn't leave town Learn to talk, teach me alchemy Now the witch can't spell what my future might be Want a lovey-dovey honey that will learn to talk I bought the gin and tonic, if you care to walk Carry on I will, my soul melting down Rotten beans, stumbling, now it's nothing but the town I'm the finest drifter you'll ever hate But I'll cook for you and I'll clean my plate",sebadoh,
"Can't think twice about the way I feel No one on Earth can stop the wheel There's an awful sound when you push me down Pin my shoulders to the ground You're so insane to close the door on me When you know everyone is going to see Things are all strewn about, can't figure out Wanna tear me apart, make a new start But you sneak on in to kick me in the shin",sebadoh,
"My soul mate is a special girl A girl that's just like me She'll share tremendous oral sex And try everything she sees She won't be insane or hung-up Like most other girls I'll worship her until it hurts Cuz she's on top of my world Ewwwww, I'm a sad man I can't ignore what life beholds for me And I'll probably have to have sex with a lot of girls Before my soul mate reveals herself to me You are sweet diversion as I stomp my darker way Don't let your heart get out of hand I'll step on it someday Maybe it's too sad to mention Maybe I am gay A moment or two may shine and sure to quickly fade away Ewwwww, it's a sad life Sometimes little sweet girls get left behind But baby, baby, baby it's a man's life And I gotta tear up everything I find",sebadoh,
"If you just wanna smoke a bowl of the finest homegrown No matter where you're coming from You can find my man there on the street You can find a man that'll peddle and you meet Weed makes you feel happy when you're feeling down Oh, yeah Weed even makes you smile when there's no one around Oh, yeah It's the weed that makes you sing when you're... Half-asleep, you can sing... Bored and nothing to do We sit In a Beat up old Chevy He'll tell ya; he'll tell He'll tell ya Yeah, he'll tell ya Yeah, I guess he'll tell ya No problem",sebadoh,
"If I'd had any sense, would it come to grips? If I go on home, would I have stayed around so long? Sooooo... I don't know, I don't know Pressing it to your lips, threaten me with your fist We're swimming out to sea, I think I know how it will be Oh, what I wanted; all I can have Oh, what you wanted; all you can have So you keep the change; you stay the same And no one can tell",sebadoh,
"No, I mean it, I'm really sorry; here I'll say it again I want you to know it, but the more I say it The less it means in the end Working for respect's like climbing a mountain And I think I'm losing my grip Once I'm fallin' and I think I'm fallin' There's no gettin' back on pace But my face makes that sorry shape I know who I am, but I lost my grace I'm gettin' a stick and I march for more Now I was wrong, everybody knows My mouth is moving but nothing's changing I just can't leave it alone Nervous defense that's doubled to senseless Milked it dry like a bone I milked it dry like a bone I just can't leave it alone I milked it dry like a bone I just can't leave it alone But my face makes that sorry shape I know who I am, but I lost my grace I'm gettin' a stick and I march for more Now I was wrong, everybody knows Everybody knows No, I mean it, I'm really sorry; here I'll say it again I want you to know it that the more I say it",sebadoh,
