"Yr bounce to the ounce makes us wanna pounce Yr just being totally perfect On Larry King you said you were tired Time to put to bed yr competitive edge They say you can't say no to Brahma Now you don't have to try so hard The label says you don't have to wear less clothes It's time to take a bubble bathChorus Hey hey little baby breakdown Button up baby you come undone Hey hey little baby get down Before you fall and hurt someoneYou say you need privacy Broken glass everywhere Maybe you need an emo boy No underwear on the director's chair You are seemingly unconscious Of what yr body is doing Like Miss Monroe yr head don't know Exactly what yr body's doingChorusOn TV you're soft and whispery Delicate like angel food cake They say if you press too hard on it It will squish into a dense ball It will lose its fluffiness That's what you get when you use a box mix Can you get some satisfaction How much are you willing to pay?ChorusWhat's yr gut feeling about the new deal How's the label gonna remake you? How was yr date with Eminem Did he bake you and then forsake you Is innocence gonna still overtake you Like Arthur Doyle they can't fake you Oh Mariah you are endless Like the wind, you feel defenselessChorus",sonic youth
"If I could give you anything I would give you a kick You'd rather have a dollar Than a hug from your sis You really fucked up this time Your old lady's really pissed She's not just laughing She's polishing her fistIf you could give me anything Would you consider a fist? Don't give me yr soul It's caught is an abyssHere's a pack of ciggies Fresh from the wonder lips A dream, a wish, a heart's desires Cinderella is a kissA cold is gonna take you And freeze away your tears Ome a little closer honey You can be so nearMind your heart aside you (?) Really got no sense of time (?) Ninety-nine inside you (?) That I'm scared if you were cryin'If I could give you anything I would give you a kick You'd rather have a dollar Than a hug from your sisA cold is gonna take you And freeze away your tears Come a little closer honey We can be so near",sonic youth
"Lee: ...god, that really sounds incredible. well actually, the reason I'm calling you has to do w/ wharton-tronix Wharton: chuckles L: I'm wondering if you're still interested in recording Sonic Youth, or like doing some work with us there. W: Uh-huh L: At your place, what..um.. basically whats going on right now is, um.. we're sort of biding our time waiting for Neutral to get together to uh, you know, do our album and all this stuff.. W: Right L: And we decided we would like to try and release a quickie single, like as quick as possible, just like 2 or 3 songs.. and um, just do it as inexpensively as possible, and we were thinking about doing it in four-track or something like that. W: Right L: And you know I talked to you about these incredible four-track recordings that you were making and so, um, I was wondering if you were actually still interested in working with us on it and doing it at your place.. and you know, if the whole thing goes well, we could probably give you some cash and stuff if it comes out.. W: Right L: I mean, I'm not really sure what.. what the deal's gonna be, we're probably gonna be trying to do it as.. W: Right, inexpensive.. L: ..you know, completely cheap, yeah, like I think you can get a thousand singles for like around $400 or something like that.. W: Right L: and uh, so we're figuring out if we can afford to pay for a sleeve or just have 'em white or what... W: Fold em yourself (chuckles) L: What? Yeah, well that's.. don't laugh! That's exactly what.. W: Well i did it! L: You did? The Glorious Strangers one? W: Right, the cover cost me $28.. L: For how many? W: (chuckles) I still have boxes of them.. L: No, but I mean how many did $28 buy, a thousand? W: Yeah L: It did!? W: At least.. L: Incredible! W: But I had to fold it all myself L: Yeah but thats okay! Because the place where they sell you the singles wants $200 for like a black and white photo sleeve.. and that's a lot of money! W: Yeah (chuckles) L: You know, I mean if we're trying to do it inexpensively.. W: Right, this is the great inexpensive way. L: Yeah W: And you know, you can off-set.. you could put..do anything on the cover you want, basically L: Right, right W: I just got it.. L: Did you cut them to that proper shape and everything, with the little flaps and all that? W: Well I had it figured out.. L: Uh-huh W: You know when I centered the thing, that there would be flaps on each side and I just figured out how to do it.. and I had it down to like a four-thing procedure... L: Uh-huh W: ...and I got these gluesticks... L: Yeah, they're great! They're really great.. W: And you just go [makes gluestick noise], you know, and now, admittedly, you know, if they don't get sold, they fall apart in the store (chuckles) L: Oh god.. well we're gonna put them inside little plastic bags also I think.. so they don't fall apart.. W: Well you'll find that the plastic bags are expensive. L: Well Thurston said, like $25.. no wait, 25 for a dollar... so that would be like $40 for a thousand, that's not too expensive.. W: That's not too bad.. L: No I thought it was gonna be even more than that.. maybe you could even get them cheaper if you tried to buy a thousand, maybe you could get em for $30 or something like that... but I was really worried about the [tape cuts off]",sonic youth

"We had just left shore when everything began to happen at once. The water came in and we started to go down. I looked to Jill and she looked back, thinking it would be alright to go down. Then the railings broke and the motors gave out. The hall emptied out, and no-one was left for the band. The amps all wet, speakers burst. Soaked. We, up three flights now, tried to meet up with the galley crew but it seemed everyone had gone. We had a smoke to pass some time.Jill said ""I'd love to, right now"". What could I say? We did while the waters rose, licking our feet. It was fun and funny so we laughed.I loved the way she could laugh. So full bodied. When we hit the sky we were high over the rooves. A field of gnarled antennae coiling upwards. Waves and waveforms joining in a nice hot blast. So different from the boat.The cold silver sky opened for us, and we passed through. Last I saw of Jill she was heading backwards into the coils of the antennae, laughing, so beautiful. Saying she hadn't yet had her fill of the boys there and the electricity. Saying she wanted to plug in again and fry a bit.I said ""Watch the water love"". She kept laughing and shook her hair. She said ""I'd love to, right now, you know?"" So we did and had a smoke too and her lips parted. There in amongst the coiling snakes of the antennae she looked right at home. The waves came up and a blinding flash caught me dreaming of her as she looked all crossed with wires and spikes watching the blast. Everything went orange and all my thoughts dissolved in the cloud. I thought one last: how different from the sea is the boat......",sonic youth

"Hatred I hate the pastI can't see anything at all, all I see is me That's clear enough And that's whats important, to see me My eyes can focus My brain is talking Looks pretty good to me My head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful Looks pretty good to meSometimes I speak Tonight there's nothing to say Sometimes we freak And laugh all dayHold these pages up to the light See the jacknife inside of the dream A railroad runs through the record stores at night Coming in for the deep freezeMary: a simple word, are you there in the country? Yr eyes so full, yr head so tight Can't you hear me? Remember our talk That day on the phone? I was the door, and you were the station With shattered glass and miles between us We still flew away in the conversationMy cup is full, and I feel okay The world is dull, but not todayShe think's she's a goddess She says she talks to the spirits I wonder if she can talk to herself? If she can bear to hear it?This is Eric's trip We've all come to watch him slip He's slipping all the way to Texas Can you dig it?(Eric says ""The sky is blue..."") I see with a glass eye The pavement view A shadow forming, across the fields rushing Thru me to youWe tore down the world, and put up four walls I breathe in the myth I'm over the city, fucking the future I'm high and inside yr kissWe can't see clear But what we see is a alright We make up what we can't hear And then we sing all nightScattered pages and shattered lights A jacknife and a dream There's something moving over there on the right Like nothing I've never seen",sonic youth
