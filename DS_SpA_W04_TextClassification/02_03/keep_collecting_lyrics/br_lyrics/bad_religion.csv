"God rest ye jerry mentlemen, Let nothing you dismay. Remember Christ our savior was born on Christmas day, Who saved us all from Satan's hand when we had gone astray.Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy. Good tidings of comfort and joy.Now, when he was a little lad, he walked around this place. He had two stilts for feet, And he had whiskers on his face, But then he died upon the cross and left but just a trace.Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy. Good tidings of comfort and joy.",bad religion
"It's a love song to the self, a story recapped every day, It's a world of bogus feelings and a world of slow decay, It's a world of laughter hidden by this world of fear and torment, It's a game of strange compulsion, our visceral convulsion: Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain, Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain. Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man. Foundation of society, anxiety. Suppress it if you can. The caste of coffee achievers didn't perform like they planned. The morning rush hour traffic is our play of false elan. So run around your frantic track and lay you down to sleep; Tomorrow's the redemption, we strive for that exception. Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain, Anxiety, a fear that you have nothing more to gain. Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man. Foundation of society, anxiety. Suppress it if you can. What are we angry for? We all need a common cure. That common goal for which you strive: To have more than the other (have more than the other) guy. The quest for truth, the quest for gold, yeah, we end up all the same The common lie, the righteous cry, we end up all the same. The angry crowd, those lost and found, everybody's all the same. The poet's pen, these words I lend, we all bend to Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain, Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain. Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man. Foundation of society, anxiety.",bad religion
"What you do is what you are And wishing upon distant stars Won't improve the hole you're in Won't absolve your deepest sin But action is no gift from some covert and lofty god It's dependant and weighty all the same And it is oh so easy just to keep to yourself But then you're at the mercy of imbeciles Now I didn't make up the rules But clearly we are led by fools It is wise to know their ways So you know how not to behave But sometimes we find ourselves in desperate need And we look to those with privilege and power It's then we learn compassion sits inert on their shelves We're at the mercy of imbeciles NO Actions is no gift from some masked spirit in the sky It's reducible to flesh, mind, and bone And it is oh so easy just to keep to yourself But then you're at the mercy of imbeciles Imbeciles Imbeciles IMBECILES",bad religion

"Maybe it's too late for an intellectual debate, but a residue of confusion remains.Changing with the times, and developmentally tortured minds are the average citizen's sources of pain. Tell me what we're fighting for? I don't remember anymore, only temporary reprieveAnd the world might cease if we fail to tame the beast from the faith that you release comes an atheist peace.Atheist peace.Poilitical forces rent bitter cold winds of discontent and the modern age emerged triumphantly. But now it seems we've stalled And it's time to de-evolve and relive the dark chapters of historyTell me what we're fighting for? No progress ever came from war, only a false sense of increaseand the world won't wait for the truth upon a plate but we're ready now to feast on an atheist peace.Atheist peace",bad religion
"everybody wants do dance in a playpen, but nobody wants to play in my garden. I see the hippies on an angry line, guess they don't get my meaning, I'm enchanted by the birds in my blossoms, I'm enamored by young lovers on the weekend, I like the Forth of July, when bombs start flashing,and I wish I had a shiny red top, a bugle with a big brass bell would cheer me up, or maybe something bigger that could really go pop! so I could make the gardening stopcome out to play, come out to play, and we'll pretend it's Christmas Day in my atomic gardenall my scientists are working on a deadline, so my psychologist is working day and nighttime, they say they know what's best for me, but they don't know what they're doing, and I'm glad I'm not Gorbachev, 'cause I'd wiggle all night, like jelly in a pot, at least he's got a garden with a fertile plot, and a party that will never stop,I hope there's nothing wrong out there, I'm watching from my room inside my room",bad religion
"He's the latest superhero with powers so profound. He can leap a dotted line in just a single bound. I know you must have seen him in books and magazines. He's the quintessential mindless modern epicine. His life is meaningful because he gets things done. Bang bang he's dead, chalk up another triumph for our hero, The Automatic Man. It's true you must have met him, he's your best friend and your foe. His opinions are determined by the status quo. A true creature of habit, he smokes three packs a day. When he has an original thought, he forgets it right away. He's a paradigm of carefree living. He's our mentor, disturb him if you can. He's the answer if your peace of mind is lacking. He's our savior, he is the common man. So if you are troubled by the daily bump and grind, Then take a careful look around and brother you will find... The Automatic Man.",bad religion
"Porcelain and alabaster, decaying ever faster, Unaware of imminent disaster open up your eyes. As you ruminate the hopeless sands of time, Did you wander out your days lost and resigned? Or recreate the universals in your mind?Everybody is a bastard: my world is like plaster Crumbling apart from pressure of the blaster Waiting for a sign And the momentary pleasures take their turn As a wistful boy runs out of things to learn, The episodes of yore are never to return.Scare up some hope, you're gonna need it just to cope You are the decision, numbers don't lie When you bite the dust, was it for purpose or for trust? You'll never relive it, think before you die. Yeah, think! Think before you die.Deficit and depravation – in the wake of desperation Rewrite the morals, rectify the nation. Now may be your time As you ruminate the hopeless sands of time, Do you wonder how your life has been defined? You know eternity can't ever change your mind. You know eternity can't ever change your mind So think! Think before you die – Yeah, think! Think before you die",bad religion
"everybody is talking about the girl who went and killed the delivery man, but she looks so kind and gentle, it just doesn't stand to reason, I saw her right there just the other night as stately as a slot machine, but when she looked my way something mad as hell came over me, anesthesia, mona lisa, I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion, I never loved you, how did you find me? the cops will never prove complicity now, anna...... all good children go to heaven! I remember your face that august night when we lied about the beautiful time to come and that crazy old man who came much to late and caused a chain reaction, I've been hanging out there for eleven long years like a church mouse wondering where the cat has gone, and looking at you now is driving me to distraction",bad religion
"Non ho bisogno di essere un cittadino globale Perchè sono benedetto dalla nazionalità Sono membro di una spingerci sotto E ci sono cose Che ci tirano giù Ma c'è un potere Ed una presenza vitale Che si sta espandendo tutt'attorno.

Sono triste per la popolazione della terra perchè così pochi vivono negli U.S.A. Al massimo gli stranieri Possono copiare la nostra moralità loro possono visitare ma non stare. Solo una preziosa minoranza Può immagazzinare la prosperità. Ci fa camminare con una presunzione risorta. Sappiamo dove andare quando muoriamo E gli architetti risiedono proprio qui. Noi abbiamo il Gesù americano Che travolge milioni ogni giorno. (esercitando la sua autorità). E' il campo sterile del contadino, la forza che maneggia l'esercito, l'espressione sulle facce dei bambini morenti di fame, il motore che guida il clan, Il motivo e la coscenza Degli omicidi, E' il predicatore in TV, La falsa sincerità, Le lettere che son state scritte Dal grande computer, E' una bomba nucleare ed i bambini senza madre e sono spaventato perchè lui è dentro di me.",bad religion

(Epitath EP1-BRLP1, 1982/85) How Could Hell Be Any Worse? was Bad Religion's first album, recorded back in 1982. When the band was trying to avoid becoming irrelevant in 1985, they rereleaed this album. Nowadays, most people probably know it as tracks 1-14 of the  80-85  CD. The lineup at that time was Greg Graffin (vocals and harmonies), Jay Bentley (bass guitar), Brett Gurewitz (lead and rhythm guitar), and Pete Finestone (drums). Greg Hetson was still only a pseudo-member. He laid down a guitar solo and helped out with the recording, and soon after he was a full-fledged member, playing live with the band (so even though he didn't play on either recording from their  original line-up  period, he's considered to be part of the original band).

Bad Religion: Back to the Known EP (Epitath EP1-BREP2, 1984) After their first album, as band members slowly drifted away, Greg Graffin gradually changed the direction of their music, eventually playing neo-psychedelic folsky songs that nobody seemed to like. After releasing the album Into the Unknown and a few tracks on compilations, the band finally broke up, Greg moved back home, and that appeared to be it for Bad Religion. Then, in 1984, Greg moved back to LA and he and Greg Hetson restarted the band. Although Greg's two original songwriting partners (Brett, the original guitarist, and Jay, the original bassist) were missing, it was still a reuinion of sorts and a return to straightforward punk rock (although a bit slower than their old music). Toward the end of the year, after playing a few shows, they went into the studio, with Brett engineering and producing, and recorded a new 5-song EP called Back to the Known, which most people nowadays know as tracks 21-25 on the  80-85  CD. This EP is also known as  The Slow Record  (although compared to Into the Known, and later albums like Recipe For Hate, it doesn't sound so slow...) The lineup was Greg Graffin (vocals), Greg Hetson (guitars), Tim Gallegos (bass), and Pete Finestone (drums). Sequence: Yesterday Frogger Bad Religion (Theme Song) Along the Way New LeafThe lyrics on this EP are essentially guesses; hopefully someone can correct my errors before they cause irreparable harm to the fabric of the universe....",bad religion
