Thought you could face the world now you lost your nerve All the things you held so close until the tables turned And when I tried to warn you still you took the risk How did I know we'd drift apart how did I know it would come to this Now everything is over and it never will return You're just a part of my life a memory I wanna burn I could feel it ending you won't face the truth I can't live with all your lies I can't take more of your abuse No I can't take anymore Don't apologize to even the score Hypocrisy and unity they're not just words to me No I can't take anymore Want to send you a letter just to put your mind at ease I could write it up in the sky I still don't think that you could see You won't admit that it's over you won't face the truth I can live with all your lies I can't take more of your abuse All the things you try to hide won't wash away All the life you took from me you can't disguise will never fade So don't look for the answers or somewhere to place the blame There's nothing that can save you now can't get back what you threw away,pennywise
A burning plane as its going down the last scream before it hits the ground A lost ship on a raging sea a blinking distress signal of emergency A run away train careening off the tracks the last breath before a heart attack The earthquake as it shakes your room promising falling skies in impending doom One chance you feel it before you meet with your destiny One chance you need it to com to terms with mortality All thats important to me Everything inside of me All that's trivial will fade and soon recede you will see when on a date with destiny Look in the jaws of your own demise watch your life pass before your eyes Did you live like a dream come true or did you just survive? Did you do all you could do? In a fall from a burning tower What would you do with just one more hour? Live that hour out everyday Like it was your last you'll live much better that way You're on a date with destiny,pennywise
"When the world's coming down like an anvil on your head. You must make it, you can take it, if you just kick back. It's all part of living this surviving dread. But tell me when all's done and said. Who needs depression. You can hit the bottle or hit something instead. You can take the bottle break it over someone's head. Take your time, keep peace of mind, and smile bigtime.",pennywise
"I don't want anything for Christmas I wanna be naughty, not nice We'll burn all your trees down 'cause all days in this town it's such an ugly sightIt looks like Christmas but you just can't tell It's joyful and triumphant but to me it feels just like Christmas in hell! Christmas in hell! Christmas in hell! Christmas in hell!

Within all of us is the instinct to survive And to win at any cost In the fight to stay alive We fear the foreign cultures That are different from our own And make enemies from strangers Who are just people we don't know We fight amongst ourselves We obliterate ourselves yeah yeah And we compete until we die Even though we don't know why We believe in ancient lies We compete until we die We struggle against each other To get things in life we need And even more to give us the status Which in return will help us breed We separate ourselves by the color of our skin And the country where we're born And which god we believe in And we compete until we die We believe these ancient lies If we could only change our minds maybe then we'd all survive,pennywise

"Been stuck on the outside since I can't remember when Got up just long enough for them to beat me down again They crawl inside my mind hoping there to find Ways to be fucking with my head They'll never get the best of me I'm fighting back until I'm deadCause I've been used been abused I've been bruised I've been broken And I'm backed up against the wall But my will to survive can't be stolen And you can't make me fallHalf-wits and dim pundits try to ruin my good name Parents and therapists tell me I'm the one to blame They say ""take it like a man"" but I can't understand Why they won't leave me alone Best friends and enemies think I'd do better on my ownChorusWhen I think I can't go on just want to stay home in my bed The problems of this fucked up world seem to be kept up in my head I take a look around there's nowhere to be found Somewhere to justify my life I guess I'll try to keep on trying someday I'll get it rightChorus",pennywise

Up from the ashes and over the hill We knew more than we ever will Back when the days passed by so slow And now we'll never know That sense that tomorrow was far away And our dreams they never fade We never thought the good times could end Can we go back to those days - When everything was simple then? And nothing could ever change Can we go back to those days - We didn't have a care at all I wish I could remain - Back in yesterdays Pictures of another place and time They seem like scenes from a diffrent life We didn't notice as the days went past We knew it couldn't last But looking back I wouldn't change a thing The memories shared they'll always stay with me We never thought the good times would end,pennywise

Shot down a million times But I won't be fooled again I need some time to figure it out And put things on the mend They say that time heals all Well I hope that's true for me Been stabbed in the back so many times By my troubled history Just need a reason why can't I just justify All the pain and suffering Yell Out in defiance Your world's not for me Confused on a path down a one-way street Blind from what I can't see I did it once before like some stupid trend But I won't be fooled again Blank stares from a million eyes That are looking back at me I sit around and ask myself Just what the fuck they see Am I all that you ever wanted Do I fit your policy? Wont be a victim of your mad disease Or your uniformity,pennywise
"Looking ahead not far away Someday soon but not today Things may get better, things may get worse Depending on who gets there first Nothing in common, nothing will change Together we'll go our separate ways Nothing to stop us from caving in Someone's got to lose when someone winsLook at the world you're living in Someday you'll have to pick a side For the rest of your life Who's on your side?A voice in the dark a light in the haze A flame that burns then fades away Alone in the night, a ship lost at sea A state of emergency With no way of knowing what's coming next Survival of who fits in best Looking for answers, but where to begin? We all want to know how this one endsLook at the world you're living in Someday you'll have to pick a side For the rest of your life Who's on your side?Look at the world you're living in Who's on your side? ????????

I've heard it all before Could hear it all a thousand times more Playing with me all the time No one feels the same And sanity is all a game Locked up deep inside my mind Hey die - you want an alibi Hey quit - you want to get a fix Hey try - you'll never make it tonight You can feel it deep inside All of the illusions for myself What if I try to make amends for someone else What if I try to change the way I'm feeling deep inside What if I died filled with sorrow wanting another try No one can face the truth Was there nothing more that you could do What would you do different next time Keep turning from the past The future's coming much to fast Or is it all in my mind,pennywise

I've got a question for all you sinners Have you ever wondered is this all there is to life? A quick adventure not much to mention A slow procession leading us to die Or is there a heaven a distant valley A golden meadow waiting for us in the sky No one right answer spirit seems broken Still I just can't help but wonder why Seems like a tragic waste of time Who cares what happens when you die? Life's too short to wonder why Get on with your life In towering churches and holy temples They all conspired to tell me how to live my life But no religion or new theism Could ever provide proof to quench my mind And now I wonder whos's sky I'm under Is there a heaven waiting for me when I die No one right answer spirit seems And still I can't help but wonder why So many questions I can't tell the difference Too many abstract thoughts now wrestle in my mind But through the darkness somewhere should be waiting A final truth to shower me with light Their pearls of wisdom and tales of glory They fed me nicely until I found it was all a lie No one right answer spirit seems broken And still I can't help but wonder why,pennywise
