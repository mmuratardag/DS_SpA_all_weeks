"I was feelin' kinda beat, I decided To hit the streets. I was lookin' For a place for this heart of Mine. Well I said to myself, oh God this must be hell I think I was slowly losin' my mind [Chorus:] Well round and round she goes Where she'll stop nobody knows. Y'know that woman put a spell On me, but if you start me, start Me, start me you can't stop me, Stop me, stop me. When she begins To rock, honey, I begin to roll I was hangin' by the phone, tired Of sleepin' alone Baby tell me where did I go wrong? When Minutes seem like hours and Days seem like weeks, how could A year last so fucking long? [Chorus:] Well round and round she goes Where she'll stop nobody knows. Y'know that woman put a spell On me, but if you start me, start Me, start me you can't stop me, Stop me, stop me. When she begins To rock, honey, I begin to roll I was hangin' with a couple Of chicks, man I was just looking For a place for this raggedy ol' Heart of mine. [Chorus:] Well round and round she goes Where she'll stop nobody knows. Y'know that woman put a spell On me, but if you start me, start Me, start me you can't stop me, Stop me, stop me. When she begins To rock, honey, I begin to roll.",social distortion

Then your head is rolling in all that shit [Chorus] The justice system is slow it's true So we'll have to take care of you You're only safety is suicide Face it buddy it's the end of the ride [Chorus] Moral Threat",social distortion
[Originally by Pscyhedelic Furs]Caroline laughs and It's raining all day She loves to be one of the girlsShe lives in the place In the side of our lives Where nothing is Ever put straight She turns herself round And she smiles and she says 'This is it' 'That's the end of the joke' And loses herself In her dreaming and sleep And her lovers walk Through in their coatsPretty in pink Isn't she? Pretty in pink Isn't she?All of her lovers All talk of her notes And the flowers That they never sent And wasn't she easy And isn't she Pretty in pink The one who insists He was first in the line Is the last to Remember her name He's walking around In this dress That she wore She is gone But the joke's the samePretty in pink Isn't she? Pretty in pink Isn't she?Caroline talks to you Softly sometimes She says 'I love you' and 'Too much' She doesn't have anything You want to steal Well Nothing you can touch She waves She buttons your shirt The traffic Is waiting outside She hands you this coat She gives you her clothes These cars collidePretty in pink Isn't she?
