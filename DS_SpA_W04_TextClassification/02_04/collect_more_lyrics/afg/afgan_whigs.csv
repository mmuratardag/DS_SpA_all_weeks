"(Arlen/Harberg)When a man's an empty kettle He should be on his mettle and yet I'm torn apart Just because I'm presumin' that I could be kind of human If I only had a heart I'd be tender, I'd be gentle and awful sentimental regarding love and art I'd be friends with the arrows and the boy who shoots the sparrows If I only had a heart Picture me a balcony Above a voice sings low ""Wherefore art thou Romeo?"" I hear a beat, how sweetJust to register emotion, jealousy, devotion and really feel the part I could stay young and chipper and I'd lock it with a zipper If I only had a heart A brain, a home, the nerve",afghan whigs
so what YOU make me hard if i was harder now i would crack into a million things things i didn't really need but how i wanted so what a nice dream didn't want to wake up so i kept it dark all the time dark enough so not to see but not as dark as the plans that YOU have for me so what YOU made me smile i had smiled at lesser things before i ever thought of YOU before i thought my soul was mine now i think about me only when i can find the time flowers all around put your lover in the ground flowers everywhere yeah yeah yeah nowhere YOU can be found i have put YOU in the ground nowhere is everywhere for YOU my flower better get myself a drink better get a couple so i can look YOU straight in the face tell YOU that i think of YOU almost as much as YOU think of YOU,afghan whigs
"(Dulli/McCollum)Ladies, let me tell you about myself I got a dick for a brain And my brain is gonna sell my ass to you Now I'm OK, but in time I'll find I'm stuck 'Cause she wants love, and I still want to fuck Now that I'm ashamed, it burns But the weight is off Now that you're out of the way I turn and I can walk You showed no sympathy, my love And this was no place for you and me to walk aloneOn my grave, am I OK? I'm sure I'm not Ladies let me tell you about my love She kept giving me more But it wasn't enough So understand Now that I come to you To understand my little self To understand my little selfAnd baby you be sweet",afghan whigs

how many girls would choose a cotton-dress world when they could have satins and lace? to stand by her man through good times and bad and still keep a smile on her face? how many hearts would feel the winter's wind blow and still not turn cold? true love travels on a gravel road love is a stranger and hearts are in danger on smooth streets paved with gold but true love travels on a gravel road down through the years we've had hard times and tears but it only helps our love grow and we'll stay together no matter how strong the wind blows not once have i seen your blue eyes fill with envy and stray from the one that you hold true love travels on a gravel road love is a stranger and hearts are in danger on smooth streets paved with gold but true love travels on a gravel road...,afghan whigs
