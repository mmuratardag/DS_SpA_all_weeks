W: Uh-huh L: At your place, what..um.. basically whats going on right now is, um.. we're sort of biding our time waiting for Neutral to get together to uh, you know, do our album and all this stuff.. W: Right L: And we decided we would like to try and release a quickie single, like as quick as possible, just like 2 or 3 songs.. and um, just do it as inexpensively as possible, and we were thinking about doing it in four-track or something like that. W: Right L: And you know I talked to you about these incredible four-track recordings that you were making and so, um, I was wondering if you were actually still interested in working with us on it and doing it at your place.. and you know, if the whole thing goes well, we could probably give you some cash and stuff if it comes out.. W: Right L: I mean, I'm not really sure what.. what the deal's gonna be, we're probably gonna be trying to do it as.. W: Right, inexpensive.. L: ..you know, completely cheap, yeah, like I think you can get a thousand singles for like around $400 or something like that.. W: Right L: and uh, so we're figuring out if we can afford to pay for a sleeve or just have 'em white or what... W: Fold em yourself (chuckles) L: What? Yeah, well that's.. don't laugh! That's exactly what.. W: Well i did it! L: You did? The Glorious Strangers one? W: Right, the cover cost me $28.. L: For how many? W: (chuckles) I still have boxes of them.. L: No, but I mean how many did $28 buy, a thousand? W: Yeah L: It did!? W: At least.. L: Incredible! W: But I had to fold it all myself L: Yeah but thats okay! Because the place where they sell you the singles wants $200 for like a black and white photo sleeve.. and that's a lot of money! W: Yeah (chuckles) L: You know, I mean if we're trying to do it inexpensively.. W: Right, this is the great inexpensive way. L: Yeah W: And you know, you can off-set.. you could put..do anything on the cover you want, basically L: Right, right W: I just got it.. L: Did you cut them to that proper shape and everything, with the little flaps and all that? W: Well I had it figured out.. L: Uh-huh W: You know when I centered the thing, that there would be flaps on each side and I just figured out how to do it.. and I had it down to like a four-thing procedure... L: Uh-huh W: ...and I got these gluesticks... L: Yeah, they're great! They're really great.. W: And you just go [makes gluestick noise], you know, and now, admittedly, you know, if they don't get sold, they fall apart in the store (chuckles) L: Oh god.. well we're gonna put them inside little plastic bags also I think.. so they don't fall apart.. W: Well you'll find that the plastic bags are expensive. L: Well Thurston said, like $25.. no wait, 25 for a dollar... so that would be like $40 for a thousand, that's not too expensive.. W: That's not too bad.. L: No I thought it was gonna be even more than that.. maybe you could even get them cheaper if you tried to buy a thousand, maybe you could get em for $30 or something like that... but I was really worried about the [tape cuts off]",sonic youth,Sonic Youth

We did while the waters rose, licking our feet. It was fun and funny so we laughed.I loved the way she could laugh. So full bodied. When we hit the sky we were high over the rooves. A field of gnarled antennae coiling upwards. Waves and waveforms joining in a nice hot blast. So different from the boat.The cold silver sky opened for us, and we passed through. Last I saw of Jill she was heading backwards into the coils of the antennae, laughing, so beautiful. Saying she hadn't yet had her fill of the boys there and the electricity. Saying she wanted to plug in again and fry a bit.I said ""Watch the water love"". She kept laughing and shook her hair. She said ""I'd love to, right now, you know?"" So we did and had a smoke too and her lips parted. There in amongst the coiling snakes of the antennae she looked right at home.
