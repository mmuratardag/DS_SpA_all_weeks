I know a girl who thinks it goes she'll make you breakfast she'll make you toast but she don't use butter and she don't use cheese she don't use jelly or any of theseshe uses vaseline vaseline (x 2)I know a guy who goes to shows when he's at home and he blows his nose he don't use tissues or his sleeve he don't use napkins or any of theseHe uses magazines magazines (x3)I know who a girl who reminds me of Cher she's always changing the color of her hair she don't use nothing that you buy at the store she likes her hair to be real orangeshe uses tangerines tangerines (x5),flaming lips
"All those bugs buzzin' round your head Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bitesThe buzz of love is busy buggin' you Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlightsWell, they bite Yeah, they bite But you can tell they're thereDoes love buzz because that's what it does? Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bitesWell, they fly in the air as you comb your hair And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlightsFly in the air, comb your hair Flies in the air, comb your hair",flaming lips
"Something in you, it jitters like a moth And I see that your arms are out to God And oh, they kill you when they talk It makes a mountain peak seem little when it's not Your incubator is so tight (2x) I've been born before, I'm pretty used to it Brain-dead is always all there isSo embryonic it's all right (2x) I've been born before, I'm gettin' used to it Brain-dead is how it always ends",flaming lips
"Their wasn't any snow on Christmas eve and I knew what I should do, I thought I'd free the animals all locked up at the zoo I opened up the fence where the peacocks were, the lamas were unleashed the snakes and seals could all get out, but they Refused to leave....All of the animals agreed they're not happy at the zoos But they preferred to save themselves, they seemed to think they could...The elephants, orangutans, all the birds and kangaroos all said thanks but no thanks man, but to be concerned is good...It started to snow on Christmas Eve in the middle of the night walkin through the state park zoo and everything is white...",flaming lips
"You can walk among us, but you can't walk on by You just keep on bleedin' on your clothes as they dry All your teflon pancakes always make me too high You're thinkin' that you're here but you're really up in the sky There she was just walkin' down the street Smoking with her hands and walking with her feet Keeping her paint cans underneath the seat Keepin' her hair dryer on her favorite piece of meat You can crush the flowers But you can't stop the spring No matter what you say So you can put the clouds up in your own little way But the sun is gonna come up the very next day It's gonna be so bright it's gonna blow you away And once it's over your head will never be the same",flaming lips
Do You Realize - that you have the most beautiful face Do You Realize - we're floating in space - Do You Realize - that happiness makes you cry Do You Realize - that everyone you know someday will die And instead of saying all of your goodbyes - let them know You realize that life goes fast It's hard to make the good things last You realize the sun doesn't go down It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning roundDo You Realize - Oh - Oh - Oh Do You Realize - that everyone you know Someday will die -And instead of saying all of your goodbyes - let them know You realize that life goes fast It's hard to make the good things last You realize the sun doesn't go down It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning roundDo You Realize - that you have the most beautiful face Do You Realize,flaming lips
"What I can't see, I surely can't believe What I can't see, you know I can't believe It's only natural that I can't believe What I can't see I've seen the birds fly, Watched the crashing tide Talked a million miles away Run through open fields Heard the words of those who kneel Still I wondered how to steal your love But I never could believe in me What've I gotta do to make you see me? Should I lay down and cry Maybe I should just die 'cause I really can't exist if you don't see me",flaming lips
"If all my dreams were a tidal wave And every day was christmas We could spend our lives in the drip At the edge of the worldCause love does things that you can't see It's like telepathic surgery And cuts and scrapes just like iggy pop thrown in a holeIf you take away my nerves And leave just my words Love would be the best thing in the worldYou and me in a chrome reflection We were born to suffer some Please don't chase me from this jail You know it looks so niceIf all my dreams were a microwave And every day was summer When I feel this way, you know We should start our own religionIf you take away my nerves And leave just my words Love would be the best thing in the world And if you take away my pain Please don't leave my brain Cause when I think it hurts just the same",flaming lips
"The seance has just been told, The slaughter has just been sold, To some people who won't get old, Cause their skin is getting cold.The room that's in the back, That's where I lost it all.

I had forgiven you for tricking me again. But I have been tricked again into forgiving you. What is this? Are you some kind of hypnotist? Waving your powers around. The sun eclipse behind the cloud.

The sun eclipse behind the cloud.,flaming lips
