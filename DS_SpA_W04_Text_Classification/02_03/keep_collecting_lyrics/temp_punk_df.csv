Bad Religion: Back to the Known EP (Epitath EP1-BREP2, 1984) After their first album, as band members slowly drifted away, Greg Graffin gradually changed the direction of their music, eventually playing neo-psychedelic folsky songs that nobody seemed to like. After releasing the album Into the Unknown and a few tracks on compilations, the band finally broke up, Greg moved back home, and that appeared to be it for Bad Religion. Then, in 1984, Greg moved back to LA and he and Greg Hetson restarted the band. Although Greg's two original songwriting partners (Brett, the original guitarist, and Jay, the original bassist) were missing, it was still a reuinion of sorts and a return to straightforward punk rock (although a bit slower than their old music). Toward the end of the year, after playing a few shows, they went into the studio, with Brett engineering and producing, and recorded a new 5-song EP called Back to the Known, which most people nowadays know as tracks 21-25 on the  80-85  CD. This EP is also known as  The Slow Record  (although compared to Into the Known, and later albums like Recipe For Hate, it doesn't sound so slow...) The lineup was Greg Graffin (vocals), Greg Hetson (guitars), Tim Gallegos (bass), and Pete Finestone (drums). Sequence: Yesterday Frogger Bad Religion (Theme Song) Along the Way New LeafThe lyrics on this EP are essentially guesses; hopefully someone can correct my errors before they cause irreparable harm to the fabric of the universe....",bad religion,punk

Who wants to be Dinah Shore Who's alter-ego is Dinah Shore Oh, his fists didn't go up so quickly this time. Yawn...yawn..yawn. Put those headphones on, it's be-bop time.I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland. The night before we played at the Long Goodbye. I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night. A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night. And well, I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this bright blue pickup drove up. It had KC lights, tractor tires, everything but the CB. It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid, right. Well, they drove up to me and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell, ""Hey, faggot,"" and showered me with some water. So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock. Now, I waited, walked down about a block to where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside, and sure enough they drove around again. They said, ""Hey, faggot, where's the nearest McDonald's"" I said, ""I don't know"" and they squirted me again. So I threw the rock and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car. They screached to a halt in the parking lot of some department store, who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer, and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling, ""We're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot, we're gonna kill you, you motherfucker."" So I got in a phonebooth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside, held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door to the phonebooth. So they began charging the phonebooth, beating on it with their club, yelling, ""We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot."" I just looked at them. So, there was a crowd gathering by this time and these kids were standing nearby and they said, ""Oh, look at him, he's insane."" I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out. I yelled at them, ""Take me to a mental hospital right away. I wanna be be put away. Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away. Please put me away now."" They said, ""Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."" So they called the police. The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks. He opens up the door, ""Get out of there, you,"" throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back. Then he goes over to the jocks, ""Now what happened here It looks like we're going have to take him to jail but we got to have the full story first"" So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole Take down on the bass, a little bit down on the bass. Yeah, ace in the hole, and they go, ""Well, goddammit, the motherfucker put a dent in my truck, a $5000 truck, right, so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him. I want to kill him. Let me kill him, goddammit. Let me kill him."" So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home, and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence.

They're crawling all over The companies think it's time we all sit down, have a serious get-together- And start another war The President He loves the idea! All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro Napalm People running down the road, skin on fire The Soviets seem up for it: The Kremlin's been itching for the real thing for years. Hell, Afghanistan's no fun So whadya say We don't even have to win this war. We just want to cut down on some of this excess population Now look. Just start up a draft; draft as many of those people as you can. We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on, hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use an automatic rifle and send 'em on their way Libya El Salvador How 'bout Northern Ireland Or a ""moderately repressive regime"" in South America We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story in the Middle East-we need that oil We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Khadafy's hit squad didn't even show up. I tell ya That man is unreliable. The Kremlin had their fingers on the button just like we did for that one Now just think for a minute-We can make this war so big-so BIG The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this right. Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls Now don't worry about demonstrations-just pump up your drug supply. So many people have hooked themselves on heroin and amphetamines since we took over, it's just like Vietnam. We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong. Kept the war functioning just fine It's easy. We've got our college kids so interested in beer they don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again. Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, they wouldn't even know what it looked like So how 'bout it Look-War is money. The arms manufacturers tell me unless we get our bomb factories up to full production the whole economy is going to collapse The Soviets are in the same boat. We all agree the time has come for the big one, so whadya say! That's excellent. We knew you'd agree The companies will be very pleased.",dead kennedys,punk
