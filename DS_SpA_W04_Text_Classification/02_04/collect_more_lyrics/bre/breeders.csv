Where are tonight's crimes going?Innocent, I caught a lawman's daughter Who tried turnin' it up to unwind.Between the soles, under the stories, Waiting below - a star-hit clock.If I Offer to drive, Just know where your lifeline's going.",breeders
Ripped off You smoked the Bible Rolled it up Your last breath Hot on my back You get started Try to get somewhere You move so slow You're not even hereDear travellerIt's my death My rhythm My arithmetic I got used to Nobody ridin in the backSorrow blowin through the veins I'm over Houston You're over the night we metDear travellerThe she Scared electricity Where no human Carries a map You say you gotta burn to shine But every prism unwinds A road to ruin And this tickets mineDear traveller,breeders

"I got an empty case of wip-its No more time on the meter.Daybreak, about face, I think I'm comin' Cross another county line Are we there? Convertible cooking with nitrous, Crackin' in the air.

That's what you get When there's no time left on the meter.You get an empty case of wip-its And a boyfriend with a beeper.",breeders
