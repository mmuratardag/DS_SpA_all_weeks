"Look at this it don't fit You've put wild into it I'm amazed you've put wild into it What can I give you what can I give Cool place, I'm amazed You brought me into space You put cake down my throat and in my face What can I give you what can I takeKissing you is like kissing gravel but feel's like getting off Kissing you is like sinking down into the moss You look better upside down You look better lying downOn the move I can lose all my sympathy for you Sitting straight on the back of mother hate What can I tell you what can I say On my knees I can see all your better qualities So you freeze I make frozen into heat What can I tell you that you'll believeKissing you is like kissing gravel but feels like getting drunk Kissing you is like sinking down into the mud You look better upside down You look better lying downFor today I've arranged to be just enough deranged To relax in the arms of someone strange I promise you today I promise you today I promise you todaaaayyy",throwing muses

They took a picture And from this cold lightning living me through So I feel like an alarm clock Fire came from my mouth Is pushing me around And I'm not loving and I'm not hating I'm not creating I'm losing my friends and my young dreams That was vicious air spilled in my face out of love And out of love Keep walking If I did the same thing 500 times Could you see it in the dark? I trust the weather I try to make the bodies give me strength Do we see them in the yard? Who cares in they're rolling in bed? There's only darkness upstairs Does love sit cold 'til you put in somewhere Do objects split it at your heart? I don't see that anymore I'm colder and colder and colder,throwing muses

"Kristin: there was a girl named pike. Pike was different from the other kids in some ways. She had huge yellow teeth which jutted out from her face, Particularly when she was angry and curled her lips back. Her favorite food was oatmeal, gummy and sticky and glue-like. Actually, it was her only food. Pike's mother would try to feed her pop-tarts and fish sticks, But pike would calmly remove the offensive food and fix Herself a bowl of oatmeal which she would strap onto her Head with scotch tape, and then walk around the house While she ate, masticating wildly. Pike's manner of dress was odd. She refused to wear any shoes, But some ratty old platforms She'd found in the garbage. You couldn't tell they were ratty and old, though As she had covered them with tinfoil David: for these reasons alone, Pike was ostracized at school. The other children picked on her, Called her ?mary? and other names, Pulled her hair and stuff. It was difficult for them to accept her into the Peer group, given her idiosyncrasies. Pike was different. Often, her mother would have little fits, When she could take pike's strangeness no more, Ranting about ?what had she done wrong,? And ?how she could have raised her weird daughter differently,? And ?why did her weird daughter do this to her.? These fits had no effect on the girl however, Pike would merely place one hand aside each eye and stare directly ahead, Sometimes lending a swift kick in her mother's shin. Kristin: even the family dog, mike, Seemed determinedly against her. He was always nipping her feet And chasing her into rooms where she didn't want to be. But the last straw was the morning she woke to a pair of Aerobic shoes sitting by her bed. Accustomed to these minor intrusions, She stepped over them and reached for her ratty platforms. They were gone. At least they weren't where she left them. She called for her mother and inquired as to their location, But there was no answer, and there were no ratty platforms Anywhere in the apartment, only a pile of broken glass In front of the shattered living room window. And there on the sidewalk, four stories down, Lay here special tinfoil shoes in a tattered heap. David: as she swept up the glass fragments, Pike decided to leave. This was not a difficult decision, Given that mike was biting at her heels and barking very loudly. She leapt over the mongrel and had just enough time to grab some Provisions and some tape, before mike lunged. Pike ran barefoot into the elevator, panting. It felt good to leave. She hated the apartment and that stupid dog. In fact, she hated the whole city. But she loved her shoes, And even her yellow jutting teeth, No matter how unpopular they were at school. Pike walked barefoot out onto the street, Barefoot along the sidewalk, Scooped up her shiny, rumpled platforms And continued barefoot along the road. Kristin: as the noises of the city faded, She discovered a whole new world, A lot of green, and room for bird sounds. Cars didn't drive so fast, And children played happily. They didn't seem to be full of pop-tarts and fish sticks. On and on she walked, and soon came to a stream. On and on she walked through the stream, Against the current, her platforms dangling from her shoulder. As dusk gathered and night began to fall, The sounds of greenness enveloped her. She caught sight of that for which she had been searching: A big square entirely filled with grass. She then knew what she had been born to do. Calmly she stepped out of the stream and Into her shoes and walked towards it. She poured some oats right out of the packet, into the Bowl and taped herself to it. Slowly, she walked to the middle of the field, Looked up to the stars and masticated wildly.What blood type do you have? David: I don't know. I've never been-- I don't think I've ever-- Kristin: there are only a few. you could just say one. David: o",throwing muses
