Shut up, don't ask
promises are lies to wait for
back down construct a label
hold out on liver fiction
get leg thick prescription
skin is medicine is sickness
deep-seated obligation
some girl whose mother
flip out duck suggestion
bliss is living high and blinded
cars boats enough
imitation far digestion
she needs to trust affliction
high hopes for lubrication
come down crushed
mush
just a little touch
