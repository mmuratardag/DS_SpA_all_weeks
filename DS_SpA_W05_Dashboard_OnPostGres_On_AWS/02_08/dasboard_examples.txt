Example of final demos (what you can achieve by this Friday):
Northwind dashboard (Metabase) from a former student: https://github.com/lorenanda/northwind-dashboard
Corona dashboard (Metabase) from a former student: https://github.com/DariusTorabian/corona-dashboard
The second repo has a link to his live dashboard , but it doesn't seem to be working atm. I assume he shut down his AWS server since he doesn't need it running anymore
Bonus: Dashboard of Northwind data made with Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/profile/hao5230#!/vizhome/Northwinddataset/Dashboard1 (edited)
