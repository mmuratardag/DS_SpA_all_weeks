# Week 2 Project:

## Feature Engineering & Classification using the Titanic Challenge on Kaggle

- Learned to implement basic feature engineering
- Learned to implement basic pipelines
- Learned to implement logistic regression, decision trees and random forests with Python sklearn
- Got an accuracy score of 0.77272 in the Kaggle Challenge using random forest

Notebook can be found <a href="https://github.com/spicedacademy/tensor-tarragon-student-code/blob/mmuratardag/Week02/01_24/titanic_kaggle_submission.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>.

### TO DO later
- change the binning for age (define intervals yourself)
- bin family size with the intervals you define yourself
- (perhaps) add interactions using the most important features
