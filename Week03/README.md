# Week 3 Project:

## Feature Engineering & Regression using the Capital Bikeshare Challenge on Kaggle

- Continued to learn and implement basic feature engineering
- Continued to learn and implement basic pipelines
- Learned to implement
  - linear regression
  - poisson regression
  - regression applications with regularization -- ridge, lasso, elasticnet
  - gradient boosting and histogram-based gradient boosting
  with Python sklearn
  - gradient boosting with three other libraries -- XGBoost, LightGBM & CatBoost
- Made two submissions to Kaggle with scores .44 (sklearn) & .49 (with LightGBM)
