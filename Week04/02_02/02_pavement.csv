Oooo Oooo Ooo Oooo Ooo Ooooo Oooo…..Darlin don’t you go and cut your hair Do you think its gonna make him change Im just a boy with a new hair cut And that’s a pretty nice hair cutJudge you like a puzzle Hit you wearin muzzles Look around look around The second drummers down His telephone is downMusic seems crazy Bands start up Each and everyday I saw another one just the other day A special new fanI remember lying I don’t remember lying I don’t remember a word But I don’t care don’t care I really don’t care But did you see Jennas’ hair?Ooooo Oooo….Advertising looks and chops a must No big hair! Songs mean a lot When songs are bought And so are youFace rott down to the practice room attention and fame of korea korea korea korea!Oooooo oooo Ooooo…….,pavement
"met her when I was a drum cadet Sold her the strings off my second set yes!See myself come running back See myself come running back running back, running back, running running running backSee myself come running back See myself come running back running back, running back, running running running backasshole royal blue velvet rope castles we never had it in our vows (?)See myself come running back See myself come running back running back, running back, running running running backSee myself come running back See myself come running back running back, running back, running running running backI was in a three piece band but there were no stringson the winds and skins torn flagswe don't burned matchwe light the burned match we light the burned matchand stick a flag on it",pavement
Everybody's goin out tonight And everybody's hangin out tonight It's alrightListen to them Show when they learn how to lie You can sing along with them if you tryHoldin the spoken world up I need it. I need it. I need it.She's got a neck like a Saturday paper You read it fast before the Sunday mass Take it back it's nothing it's nothing like it talks Don't listen to me baby if you wanna survive You did it you did you did it wrong.Collapse It's evident to me Tonight All the friends are strangers.I'd like to take my story To some place the don't know me Creatures come out of the bars Talk is small but you talk to Paul Sold sex on Bird Cage walk Boys are drinking and on the docksUnion man. I'm your friend I need you when you listen to meWeigh sand Buy Sand glass track Closing off close off close off OPEC dreams stock market close on the rock And roll scale Stereo No more partridge family dreams to the home land Divorce countries,pavement
