"It's not the right time to be sober Now the idiots have taken over Spreading like a social cancer, is there an answer?Mensa membership conceding Tell me why and how are all the stupid people breeding Watson, it's really elementary The industrial revolution Has flipped a bitch on evolution The benevolent and wise are being thwarted, ostracized, what a bummer The world keeps getting dumber Insensitivity is standard and faith is being fancied over reasonDarwin's rollin over in his coffin The fittest are surviving much less often Now everything seems to be reversing, and it's worsening Someone flopped a steamer in the gene pool Now angry mob mentality's no longer the exception, it's the rule And I'm startin to feel a lot like charlton heston Stranded on a primate planet Apes and orangutans that ran it to the ground With generals and the armies that obeyed them Followers following fables Philosophies that enable them to rule without regardThere's no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred Majority rule, don't work in mental institutions Sometimes the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutionsWhat are we left with? A nation of God-fearing pregnant nationalists Who feel it's their duty to populate the homeland Pass on traditions How to get ahead religions And prosperity via simpelton cultureThe idiots are takin over",nofx

"Absolute shibari, cold noodles and hot sake The mistress bar in Roppongi is the place For Japanese hardcore, not the kind you’re gonna find at the record store Not the kind designed for the kind heartedDo not pass go, do not get bail Go directly to Osaka Jail Where you get locked or drunk under the tableFor just under 10,000 yen You can visit hell and come back again For the process of hurting and healing Cake and candle wax dessert It’s not fun ‘til someone gets hurt Who’s the next to get hung from the ceilingSo if you want rewards and consequence They got the cool and unusual punishments Get on your knees for Japanese instruction Rope and Cigarette burns, forget about any health concerns This is pure assisted self-destructionKanpai and bottoms up, unhelping hands hogtie you up One bad deed surely deserves another Bruised from bamboo caning Coming home try explaining this to your significant other Good fucking luck…",nofx
