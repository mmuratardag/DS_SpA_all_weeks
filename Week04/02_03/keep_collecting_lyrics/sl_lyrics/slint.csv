Goodnight my love Remember me as you fall to sleep Fill your pockets with the dust and the memories That rises from the shoes on my feetI won't be back here Though we may meet againI know it's dark outside Don't be afraid Everytime I ever cried from fear Was just a mistake that I made Wash yourself in your tears And build your church On the strength of your faithPlease Listen to me Don't let go Don't let this desperate moonlight leave me With your empty pillow Promise me the sun will rise againI too am tired now Embracing thoughts of tonight's dreamless sleep My head is empty My toes are warm I am safe from harm,slint
"Let me in, the voice cried softly, from outside the wooden door. Scattered remnants of the ship could be seen in the distance, Blood stained the icy wall of the shore.I'm the only one left. The storm, took them all, He managed as he tried to stand. The tears ran down his face. Please, it's cold.When he woke, there was no trace of the ship. Only the dawn was left behind by the storm. He felt the creaking of the stairs beneath him. That rose, from the sea, to the door.There was a sound at the window then. The captain started, his breath was still. Slowly, he turned.From behind the edge of the windowsill, There appeared the delicate hand of a child. His face was flush and timid. He stared at the captain through frightened eyes.The captain reached for something to hold on to, Help me, he whispered, as he rose slowly to his feet. The boy's face went pale, He recognized the sound.Silently, he pulled down the shade against the shadow. Lost in the doorstep of the empty house.I'm trying to find my way home.I'm sorry... ...and I miss you.I miss you. I've grown taller now. I want the police to be notified. I'll make it up to you, I swear, I'll make it up to you.I miss you.",slint
"I knew these two people. And, um...a boy and a girl, And they liked to hang together.They were nice people. Um...they were the people, That made you feel good To be around.Anyway, the thing was, One day, they started acting Kinda funny...kinda weird.They started being seen, Exchanging tokens of affection. And there were rumors that they were, Engaging in(?).I think that they'd run out of time.You know what happened to them? You know what they do? What they became? You know what happened to them? You know what they do? What they became? You know what happened to them?",slint
"Don stepped outside. It felt good to be alone. He wished he was drunk, Thought about something he said, And how stupid it had sounded He knew he should forget about it and decided to piss, but he couldn't... (A plane passed silently overhead, the streetlights, and the buds on the trees and the night, were still.)It finally came, he took a deep breath. It made him feel strong, and determined, To go back inside.The light. Their backs. The conversation. The couples, romancing, so natural. His friends stare, With eyes, like the heads of nails. The others. Glances. With amusement, With evasion, With contempt. So distant, With malice, For being a sty In their engagement, Like swimming underwater in the darkness, Like walking through an empty house, Speaking to an imaginary audience, being watched from outside, by no-one (A song without a key) He could not dance to anything.Don left, And drove, And howled, And laughed, At himself. He felt he knew what that was.Don woke up, And looked at the night before. He knew what he had to do. He was responsible. In the mirror, He saw his friend.",slint
I live in a castle I am a prince On days I try To please my queenSoon as I start to smile My smiling queen Who sits across the table By the food she madeLike a bat I flushed the girl And I flew out my back door And I came to no one no more She ran without glances And railed like a red coal trainEyelids are open When the sun is high I slip away from my queen's Grey stateI can be settled down and be doing just fine Until I heard that old train Rolling down the lineWith the light she disappeared And set me in a whirl And i hope that beautiful girlI set a fire burning And I railed on through the night I set a fire burning And I railed on through the nightShe peeked around the corner She offered me her hand My teeth touched her skin Then she was gone againNow my queen is fine In her early grave After that girl I'll keep her warm There's nothing more to save,slint
"Past where the river bends. Past where the silo stands. Past where they paint the houses. Past where they paint the houses.Take away, something that you know. The reason, that you're always there. Use it, 'til you're through. But remember, when the time comes, You got to let go.Past where the river bends. Past where the silo stands. Past where they paint the houses. Past where they paint the houses.",slint
"I stepped out onto the midway. I was looking for the pirate ship and saw this small, old tent at one end. It was blue, and had white lights hanging all around it. I decided to check out the tent, it seemed I could hear music coming from inside. As I walked toward it, I passed a crowd of people at the sideshow. I couldn't figure out why they would want to wait in line. I pulled back the drape thing on the tent. There was a crystal ball at the table, and behind it, a girl wearing a hat. She smiled, and asked me if I wanted my fortune read. I said okay, and sat down. I thought about it for a minute, and asked her if she would rather go on the roller coaster instead.Creeping up into the sky. Stopping, at the top and, starting down. The girl grabbed my hand, I clutched it tight. I said good-bye to the ground.Far below, a soiled man. A bucket of torn tickets at his side. He watches as the children run by. And picks his teeth. Spinning 'Round, my head begins to turn. I shouted, and searched the sky for a friend. I heard the fortune teller, screaming back at me. We stuck out our hands, and met the winds.The girl falters as she steps down from the platform. She clutches her stomach, and begins to heave. The ticket-taker smiles, and the last car is ready. Who told you that you could leave?The sun was setting by the time we left. We walked across the deserted lot, alone. We were tired, but we managed to smile. And the gate I said goodnight to the fortune teller. The carnival sign threw colored shadows on her face, but I could tell she was blushing.",slint
