"She knows I can't read She knows I can't write But these are the letters from melody Show me how to read Show me how to write These are the things you can do for meWhy did you kill that poor old man, melody Why did you kill that poor old man, melody She said, ?He was never good to me? She said, ?He was never good to me?Tell me how she was dressed that day, my melody Don't show me how she touched her face, my melody She said, ?I would never do it again. Give me another chance.? I said, ?Why didn't you come to me? Why didn't you talk to me??",blonde redhead
"I won't bind my strings to you But build my world besides you Watching you draw a line Some say you are, you are Just like a butterfly Whose broken wings will spread To softly feel your mood Over the blue sky full of you Pink love, pink love, pink love Just like a fairytaleMy only reason naturally Starts to get to me Pushing my way through Mesh of life I want to kiss the sickness of mind My heart without reason Sunken to deep disappointment Spreads over universe With a knife I want to bleed out distress like thisIt's not just a fairytale painted by me It's not just loneliness between you and I If on magic mountain you find you can breath Then stay and don't look back To the blue woven skyStorms of petals are pouring down Pushing their way through our pink love So many polka dots painted by me Spreads over universe for you And I, I want to kiss Pink love, pink love I want to kiss Pink love, pink love In my mind I state myself The clock is ticking without you Some may say illness So called so called love The sickness of mind",blonde redhead
We've come a long way to where the mountain is high I take my cedar to where the mountain is highWhat I need is a peace and quiet What we see is an illusion I have no reason to confuse them I have no reason to confuse my brothersThey have real shotguns They were baby killers But I warned you many times that they will burn down your houseNot today (what can I do) Not today (to make it better)What we need is a persuasion What you give is retaliation I hope one day we meet again I hope one day we love one anotherThey were young soldiers They were old liars But I heard the rumor that they will burn down your houseNot today (what can I do) Not today (to make it better)They will burn down your house They will burn down your house,blonde redhead

Once she loved a boy. But he did not love her. His name was Jun. Disillusioned she tried to forget. So she left everything & traveled to the other side of the world. But life was like a dream. A series of meaningless movement.And then by chance she met you & your brother. The moment she saw you. She knew you were made for her.You're never out of her thoughts. She sees only you.If it was yesterday he'd felt free just like her He could have been with her But today can't be anymore Tomorrow maybe yes. But today he is not there.I heard someone say That mind keeps wondering from desire to contempt From contempt to desire Never ever feeling bored. Cause we think we are free. I think it's so pathetic. Don't you ? Were you listening to me. No not even one word.I heard someone say that mind keeps wondering Life is like a dream. A series of meaningless movement. I heard someone say Let's go to the other world Because we think we are free. A series of meaningful MovementLa la la,blonde redhead
