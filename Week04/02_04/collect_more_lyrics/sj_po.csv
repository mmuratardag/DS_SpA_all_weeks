I see you gracefully swimming with the country club women in the Greenwood southside society pool. I love your amethyst eyes and your protestant thighs you're a shimmering socialite jewel.  From the Carbon Dioxide Riding Academy to the children's crusade marching through the downtown. Well I think I'd die see if you just said hi to me. When something breaks it makes a beautiful sound.  Sometimes I feel like I'm watching the world and the world isn't watching me back. But when I see you I know I'm in it too. The waves come in and the waves go back. The kids in the corner all covered in dirt. Caught trespassing under the moon. My father came in from wherever he'd been and kicked my shit all over the room.  The room is dark and heavy with what I want to say. I see murals in the radio static and on your blue jeans. What would you say if I asked you to run away? It's been done so many times I hardly know what it means.  I took these blue arrangements and threw them in the sea when older waves from older caves brought them back to me. I took these blue arrangements and stored them on a shelf. With change on the mantle and time in a candle in the end a boy raises himself,silver jews,indie
"Back then I had a Buckingha rabbit. I'd been lonely since she found Christ. Now is the time to depend on the law: the nights of my professional life.  I was living in a very young city. Grand piano great lakes good-bye. If you ask me my name it's high-low-jack in the game. I can track a single bee to the hive.  Every single game was a blowout. And the Nascar blurred into porn. Scenic this scenic that don't fall for the traps of the man who was never born.  And so the rent became whiskey and then my life became risky: shattered dogs on the rocks.  At the back of the bar there's a couch where the lonely people go and lie. They talk to the honky tonk psychiatrist into the wee hours of the night.  The factories on muscle relaxers. The pine perfume of hilltown floors. The lover the thinker the talker the singer won't be lucid for her anymore.  When you know how I feel I feel better When you're 15 you want to look poor. Do unto others and run like a mother I don't want to look poor anymore  Jesus in a runaway shelter said ""The deaf have pictures of you."" From the digital fountains to the analog mountains let the mirrow express the room",silver jews,indie
lookin over i can see you for free and i think you could be some kind of four-leaf clover growin undiscovered inside me merry faces in your favorite crowd so now you wanna go while i wished it were the other one laughs aloud just to let me know i can't deny that i'll be there until i find that it's free there  well maybe someday you'll smile instead of turnin the other way and you'll realize this is the place you need and you're gonna stay lookin over my shoulder is the only way i'll ever see you when you hover yourself high up above me just lookin down  now and then i'll see you here and there but now you're everywhere you will have to decide that if you walk on by or return your stare lookin over my shoulder is the only way i'll ever see you when you hover yourself high up above me just lookin down i can't deny that i'll be there until i find that it's free there,polvo,indie
Once upon a time We used to count stars on a clear night The street lights have made it hard to see You say there's magic in the drowned out constellations Won't you make it magical for me? When we're drifting through the chaos of the city You're only looking straight ahead I want to stop to take a picture of the skyline You would rather burn it down instead Can I hold the weight of your mind? Can I have a taste of your mind? Can I climb the hill of your mind? Can I learn the ways of your mind? Can I buy the weight of your mind? Can I try a piece of your mind? Can I see the hole of your mind? Can I see the hold in your mind? I try to understand that greatness is a blessing Even though it doesn't seem to be You watch the passion with the wonder of a stranger Won't you make it wonderful for me? When we're passing through equations of disaster I subtract myself from what I see You say there's beauty in the nature of a nightmare Can't you make it beautiful for me? Can I hold the weight of your mind? Can I have a taste of your mind? Can I climb the hill of your mind? Can I learn the ways of your mind? Can I buy the weight of your mind? Can I try a piece of your mind? Can I see the hole of your mind? Can I see the hold in your mind? Can I hold the weight of your mind? Can I have a taste of your mind? Can I climb the hill of your mind? Can I learn the ways of your mind? Can I buy the weight of your mind? Can I try a piece of your mind? Can I see the hole of your mind? Can I see the hold in your mind? Can I hold the weight of your mind? Can I have a taste of your mind? Can I see the hole of your mind?,polvo,indie
