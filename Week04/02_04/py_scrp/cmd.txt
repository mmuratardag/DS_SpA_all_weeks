Commands we used today:
if you use input(), you can give a description inside the brackets and this will prompt you to type in the text in the terminal.
When using argparse, there are two options:
if you have positional arguments, then just give them in the order that you added them to your parser. They are required.
if you are using flags (--t, -text) which makes the arguments optional: prefix the argument  when you give it in the terminal with the appropriate flag.
E.g:
Positional: python main.py "Waterloo honey dance" 5
Optional: python main.py -text "Waterloo honey dance" -max_depth 5
You can also have positional AND optional arguments.
